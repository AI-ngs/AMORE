Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,"Y¡¯all. I¡¯ve tried so many cheaper alternatives before purchasing this and ended up spending more money on things that don¡¯t work instead of just getting this. Don¡¯t waste your money on a bunch of random lip masks you¡¯ll hope works out. My lips have been through it this winter, cracked and bleeding everyday. I¡¯ve used this for less than a week and my lips are feeling brand new already. No more pain and bleeding! Smells great. And I¡¯ve had issues with other lip products breaking me out around my mouth but this one is great for sensitive skin. I literally never review but I finally caved in and got this product since everyone raves about it and I am happy I did! It was worth it and it comes with a lot of product so the price isn¡¯t that bad actually"
Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,Have been using this lip mask for years in all flavors. Love them!
Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,Best flavor yet like a grape skittle
Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,So refreshing! Lips are so soft! Smells good too.
Lip Sleeping Mask,21-Dec-25,Absolutely TERRIBLE! Caused extreme burns on my lips. I was blaming a lipstick I was wearing but it turns out it was the lip mask that I paid 24.00 !!! Awful product!
Lip Sleeping Mask,21-Dec-25,"I purchase this every year during Prime day sales. I like it, it feels nice but if i¡¯m honest, I have not noticed much of a difference from it,
I use it every night before bed and it last a long time but if it wasn¡¯t for the sale I would not buy this brand. I have the Elf lip mask as well and it is very nice."
Lip Sleeping Mask,21-Dec-25,"Tengo 38 a?os, y llevo dos semanas usando el contorno de ojos y tambi?n le aplico a mi esposo, y las l?neas finas se han atenuado en ambos. Gran producto !"
Lip Sleeping Mask,20-Dec-25,Very expensive for what it is.
Lip Sleeping Mask,20-Dec-25,Keeps lips smooth! It's great! Wonderful flavor.
Lip Sleeping Mask,20-Dec-25,"I love this lip mask it's my favorite ""go to"" for chapped lips. It smells great & I love the buttery softness. Check it out bet you'll love it too!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,Incredible sleep mask for dry lips or to just keep your lips moist on a daily basis. I never miss a night putting it on before going to bed. Amazing product feel and scent.
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,I love is mask. Hydrating and makes my lips soft.
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,This is a fun Christmas gift---I love the original pot of sleeping mask but these minis seem like a nice little Christmas remembrance for friends.
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,doesn't stay on while sleeping.
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"This stuff is great. It¡¯s one of the only glosses that doesn¡¯t wear off immediately. I use it every night before bed and I still feel it the next morning. Not greasy or heavy, smells wonderful and doesn¡¯t taste bad. I love it and will buy again."
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Its nice I guess, I'm not seeing the hype tho to be honest. I take good care of my skin and lips and wanted to try it out for a long time, but honestly I've had better results by using jojoba oil or something similar. The packaging and smell is wonderful though"
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,Good product but the minis are more worth it. The packaging is portrayed as if the container is full but they have the entire bottom of the container al carved out. There is only a few uses in each one. I understand the point of samples. But this is false advertising.
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Great product, makes a great stocking stuffer!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,Wore only for a few hrs my lips were really dry and now it¡¯s smooth!!! Lips are hydrated!love this!
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"I've been using this at bedtime for about a month. My very dry and peeling lips improved immediately and are staying smooth and not peeling. it comes with a little applicator, but I put a tiny amount on my pinky finger and apply. It is the best product i have ever used for lips. I got the ""berry"" version - light pink color and very subtle berry taste/fragrance."
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Los amo
Buena compra"
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Been a fan of Laneige for years - you don't have to ""sleep"" to love this lip gel! Smooth + creamy, great flavor; i am addicted to lip products, this is definitely one of my faves!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,Muy buena para idratata tus labios
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,I had high hopes for this base on the reviews. I have been trying every product know to man for chapped lips. This product in pricey and it didn't help my chapped lips at all. Definitely disappointed in this after spending over $20 on it and it had so many good reviews. Works well as a pretty gloss though. If you need help with chapped lips I recommend Okeefes and it is super inexpensive.
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"This stuff is like gold. Especially during the winter, my lips get so so dry. I haven't found anything else that helps as much as Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask. Do yourself a favor and buy this product!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"Laneige lip sleeping mask lives up to its name and reputation. I love its long lasting, glossy finish and scent that leaves my lips feel softer and hydrated in the morning."
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,I've used this off and on throughout the years. It's fantastic. I also use it on my cuticles. I'm sticking with it now.
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"I love this lip mask. I recommend it all the time! The tub is nice instead of a squeeze tube because you are less likely to waste. The price is not cheap, but I have been using the same little tub for probably 2 years and haven¡¯t had to buy a new one yet! Very moisturizing but doesn¡¯t feel too thick. Smells great and usually last all night!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"The LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask is an excellent product for anyone dealing with dry or chapped lips. The texture is rich yet lightweight, and it feels very comfortable on the lips without being sticky. After applying it before bed, lips feel noticeably softer, smoother, and deeply hydrated by morning.

The Gummy Bear scent is pleasant and subtle, adding a fun touch without being overpowering. A little product goes a long way, making the jar last for a long time. The formula locks in moisture overnight and helps repair dryness, especially during colder weather."
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"This is obviously witch magic. It literally heals my lips in mere hours. I am a new woman in cold, dry Colorado winters"
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and this product really does live up to it. It makes my lips feel incredibly smooth and soft, even after just one use.

I especially struggle with dry, cracked lips in the winter, and this keeps my lips moisturized and comfortable overnight. I wake up with lips that feel noticeably healthier and crack-free.

A little goes a long way, and it¡¯s quickly become a must-have in my nightly routine."
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"Do not recommend this product. It doesn't help your lips at all. I have been using it religiously for the last 2 months, and I have not noticed any changes. I continue to need chapstick throughout the day and Vaseline before even applying this before bed. I also scanned the barcode on this item and it is extremely toxic to humans and the environment ! I will never be buying this product again and I highly do not recommend it. In the trash it goes !"
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,This is a product that lives up to the advertising. Makes your lips look and feel amazing.
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"Used it last night and so far so good. I saw a dramatic improvement in my lips. My lips have never been this cracked and dry ever in my life, so I was desperate for something that would work."
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"This should not be a product for sale. If anything, it could be a gift with other purchases since this is a sample size.
Not only it¡¯s extremely small. But once you see the bottom, IT¡¯S EVEN SMALLER!!!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Best stuff ever buy this set
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Love this stuff.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,A friend recommended this for overnight use and I¡¯ve used it ever since.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"I bought this after seeing an influencer share it saying it was one of her favorite things and that she has used it nightly for over a decade. I found that my lips got SO DRY and cracked when I used this. I wanted to love it, but I just hated it instead. It had the opposite effect on my lips from what it is meant for, sadly. I used it nightly for about 2 weeks and as soon as I stopped using it, my lips healed and were no longer dry and cracked."
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,My daughter loves this.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Best lip sleeping mask
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"I didn't realize when I ordered it that it was 3 flavors in one and it is amazing, very hydrating, light on the sent, doesn't bother my sensitive skin. The only down side is the price it is quite pricey but worth the spurlge every once in a while."
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"Best night, lip mask ever!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Great product!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,This is my favorite scent
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Great stocking stuffer!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"All I can say is I live eat and breathe with this stuff now. I really like the sleeping mask for my lips. I wake up and my lips are not dry anymore. When I¡¯m getting close to running out, I always buy another one. I can honestly say that if I had to do this on TikTok, it would be a true review. I highly recommend the LANEIGE lip sleeping mask!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,My favorite lip product!! So smooth and feels amazing!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Works wonders
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Arrived in very damaged box but product okay.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,These are the best lip mask but I was worried the chocolate might be overpowering. It wasn¡¯t it was perfect and now one of my favorites.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Fantastic trial sizes!!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,This was given as a gift to someone that uses Burts Bees. This works so much better!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Just feels like an overpriced lip balm that didn¡¯t do much for me.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"Love these! Slight tint of color. I use these as a gloss, not a mask"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,I wear a c-pap for sleep apnea each night. The gel helps my problem with dry lips.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love it!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Love this mask I use it daily for a lip gloss to keep my lips hydrated. I wish it had an applicator or you could dispense it differently instead of sticking your finger in it to get the product out. Overall I love this, my go to!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,As expected and wonderful product!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great mask!!!good price!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This product is always a hit! Pricey but lasts a very long time. I have bought this repeatedly for friends.
And it works."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Honestly wouldn¡¯t buy again, it definitely has a great texture to it but the only thing it did for me was dry my lips out ??"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Smells great and keeps my lips hydrated! I use this every night (and often during the day). I¡¯m on my third tub of it!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Smells great, works great, feels great."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"These are exactly as described. A bit pricey and doesn't last long, but I do like them."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Second purchase . Use this every night to prevent lip dryness
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love this lip product!!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Great product ,she loves it"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This is such a good lip mask! I slather my lips up when they need some extra hydration, or just in general in the winter, and it never fails to help rehydrate my lips. I have repurchased this lip mask at least 3 times at this point! The jar lasts a long time too."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Works great especially overnight! Can be used in dry cuticles too ??
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Felt moisturizing on my lips. This completes my night time skin care routine. Smells good also.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This sleep mask has been a game changer. It is extremely hydrating, and not sticky."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,LOVE! You can use this for the most glossy lips - not just at night time.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,I¡¯m addicted to this stuff! So good!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,If you use it like its meant it works. It hydrates your lips. Don't expect them to be all shiny that's only right after you put it on. It starts off feeling kinda slimy.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Cute set, perfect for a gift. The eye mask container is much larger than the smaller sized face mask, so just be aware of that - the face mask is more of a deluxe sample size. The lip mask was nice as well."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,loving so far!! it¡¯s working great. and the smell is INCREDIBLE!!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"I was starting to notice some slight wrinkles around my lips which freaked me out, but this Laneige lip mask has made a huge difference and now I refuse to go without it. It does last me a few months and I use it every night. Also so helpful during the winter months to keep your lips soft and protected."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Lasted me a long time but a little more pricey for what it¡¯s worth - there are comparable products, but you are paying for the name brand. I honestly also used outside of sleeping as a hydrator! Still lasted me forever."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love this stuff!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,This is my favorite brand. I love this sleep mask. It keeps my lips well hydrated and smooth.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Second bottle, great product"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,I¡¯m a CPAP user and my lips get horridly dry from my full face mask. I just discovered this lip mask and it¡¯s been a godsend. I don¡¯t even have to use it every night as it seems to heal my lips and keep them moisturized.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,This is one of my favorite beauty products
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great lip mask for night time nourishment to your lips! I use it every night and never worry about chapped or cracking lips from the cold.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Best sleeping mask. Only product I use.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"During season changes, my lips get very dry. The lip mask leaves my lips highly hydrated. The mask comes in a cute glass bottle and the applicator. My boyfriend and I have incorporated this to our bedtime routine. Highly recommend."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great product! I use nightly and haven¡¯t had chapped lips.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Nice smooth texture
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great product - keeps my lips soft in the winter
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,My go to product for my lips. I use every morning. I don¡¯t have to worry about dry lips. The smell is nice and goes on smoothly. Have been using for a couple years. Would highly recommend!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,A lot smaller than I expected but great quality! Love Laneige!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This is a very popular item for lip treatment, it says it's just for at night. But I use it for during the day too."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,This is so amazing! I would highly recommend the lip moisturizer.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love this. It works great on my lips.
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,Love the way it makes my lips feel. Goes on smoothly!
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,"Does this product seem a little pricey? Sure. However, even with nightly use it lasts me for at LEAST a full year, which works out to just pennies a day. How many makeup/beauty products do you have that last that long? And it works. Even in our dry midwestern winters my lips felt so good. My daughter tends to get severely chapped lips sometimes in winter, made worse by licking them and ends up with a lot of rawness around her lips...this completely eliminated the problem for her.
Still, I thought 'surely a less expensive product would do just as well?' So when my Laneige ran out I purchased a drugstore dupe that looked nearly identical. Ugh. I've tried to tolerate it, but the sticky, petroleum jelly feeling and taste are too strong. My lips feel okayish, but the sticky sensation when putting it on at night means I am not going to use this as an occasional lip balm during the day ever, unlike the Laneige. I'm not about to put up with this for as long as it takes me to use up the drugstore product; I'm reordering my Laneige."
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,Must have. Can¡¯t live without
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,"Love all the products, especially the eye mask!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,Use this all the time
Lip Glowy Balm,23-Dec-25,He probado muchos incluso de marcas famosas pero ninguno es tan bueno como este
Lip Glowy Balm,22-Dec-25,"These are by far the best lip gloss¡¯ around, my lips feel nice and moisturized after applying. With so many flavors to pick from you cannot go wrong."
Lip Glowy Balm,22-Dec-25,My lips feel dry after wearing the lip balm
Lip Glowy Balm,21-Dec-25,"I¡¯ve been loving the LANEIGE Lip Glowy Balm in Peach Iced Tea ? it gives a light, glossy tint while keeping lips hydrated all day.
Perfect if you want a natural look with moisture and shine, without heavy lipstick."
Lip Glowy Balm,20-Dec-25,I love it it last couple hours good smell taste and color it¡¯s amazing
Lip Glowy Balm,20-Dec-25,Good brand Xmas gift for granddaughter
Lip Glowy Balm,19-Dec-25,"Winter absolutely destroys my lips. Between cold air, wind, heat blasting in the car, and dry indoor air, they crack fast and stay mad about it. This Lip Glowy Balm is the one thing that actually brings them back to life overnight ?
The texture is glossy but not sticky, and it melts in quickly without feeling heavy. I put it on before bed and wake up with lips that feel soft, hydrated, and normal again, not tight or flaky. And yes, it still feels good in the morning, which says a lot. I keep one in my car for emergency lip situations and another on my bedside table because I¡¯m gonna forget if I don¡¯t. The squeeze tube makes it easy to apply without digging a finger into a pot, and a little goes a long way. The berry tint is subtle and pretty, nothing loud, just healthy looking lips ??
If winter dries out your lips like it does mine, this is a must. It¡¯s one of those products you don¡¯t realize you rely on until it¡¯s gone, and then suddenly everything feels wrong ?? Highly recommend for cold weather, travel, or anyone who wakes up with crusty lips no matter what they do."
Lip Glowy Balm,18-Dec-25,"I get this product all the time and while it might be a bit of a splurge, it is worth it!!! The whole thing lasts about 3 months so it's great for the price. Unlike other balms, this one stays on for a while, and no reapplications are necessary! While this product is not a lip mask, it works great before you go to to bed in the night, and keeps your lips moisturized the whole time. Absolutely amazing!"
Lip Glowy Balm,18-Dec-25,I give this a ten out of ten
Lip Glowy Balm,18-Dec-25,"Very thick, moisturizing formula, smells good, and softens lips almost instantly! I will be buying another soon"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,"Love the quality of this gloss, easy glide on, not sticky at all, perfect color"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,"This lip mask is the BOMB! It¡¯s. It¡¯s not tacky at all, smells great and goes nicely over a lip stain to give your lips a nice little shine. It¡¯s also great if you live in a dry climate environment like Colorado. Your lips will thank you!"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,got this on sale and the product is super nice
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,It¡¯s excellent
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,"Nice neutral tone, it¡¯s like a super sheer purple. Looks clear almost"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,I love it
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,Loveee & smells so good.
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,Good quality lip balm.
Lip Glowy Balm,16-Dec-25,My favorite lip balm! The Laneige lip balm adds a little color to my lips and keeps them moisturized! I gift it to all of my friends!
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Love this product! The color looks perfect
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"Love this lip balm! We buy so many of these. We love the feel of it, smell and the applicator is my favorite! Can¡¯t get enough!"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,I have Tried several lip balms. This is number one on my list. Last long and I use it mostly at night after a good lip scrub. I tend to have dryer lips and those works amazing.
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"The Laneige Lip Glowy Balm is a lightweight, hydrating lip balm with a glossy finish. It¡¯s designed to feel more like a lip gloss crossed with a balm ? moisturizing lips while giving a subtle tint and shiny look. It¡¯s enriched with nourishing butters like shea butter and murumuru seed butter for hydration."
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Great product. Effective for lip care
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"This lip balm lives in my bag now. It¡¯s super hydrating without being sticky, gives the perfect sheer tint, and makes my lips look healthy and glossy with zero effort. I love that it feels lightweight but actually lasts, especially for dry lips. It¡¯s my go-to for everyday errands, school drop-offs, or when I want a little something without doing full makeup. So good?I¡¯ve already repurchased. My favorite flavor is Gummy Bear!"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Love the smell. But is a bit stickier than the potted one
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"I love this product! Out of all the lip glosses I¡¯ve bought throughout my life, this has been the only lipgloss that doesn¡¯t get stuck to everything it touches. It¡¯s not sticky, it¡¯s hydrating and adds a great glossy pink color to the lips. I got the shade ¡®berry¡¯ and it smells great but not in an overwhelming way. Will buy again- in a couple months because a little goes a long way!"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"i like this lip balm but it is a little bit sticky sometimes, i like the color and scent"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,I returned it. Very sticky and strong scent
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Daughter loves this
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"My new fav! I love this balm, and this gummy bear is my new fav!"
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Kinda drying
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"I¡¯m a little disappointed because I was hoping the peach scent would be stronger, but it¡¯s barely noticeable. Formula-wise, it¡¯s still decent, and the packaging color is really cute! Sadly, this will just be an added collector piece to my growing Laneige lip balm collection. ??????"
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Cute light color
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Love this color tint and flavor. Almost makes your teeth look whiter because of the hue!
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Love it! Smooth lips no chapping and it doesn¡¯t wipe off instantly!
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Nice product
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"The matcha is a fun addition to the Laneige line up! I would definitely purchase this one again - and no, you don¡¯t have green tinted lips when applying it. It¡¯s sheer and hydrating with a subtle scent. I love the consistency."
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,My favorite lip balm. Very moisturizing.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,My absolute favorite lip balm! Maybe don¡¯t love the chocolate one as much.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Nice
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,what she wanted!
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"Love this product, adds light color and protects dry lips."
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Feels so good on lips
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Bought as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter. She swears by the Laneige Lip Moisturizers and Sleep Masks for lip hydration and repair.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,I was influenced to try this out since I wouldn't normally pay this much for a lip balm. Well I will not be able to go back to any others because this one is just so nice. It's not super long lasting but it is so soft and smooth and has a pleasant berry scent (not overpowering). It has a bit of a taste if you get some in your mouth but its not unpleasant. I like how it doesnt feel super sticky as well. I love this and will keep repurchasing.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Love this gloss. I¡¯m in my third purchase.
Lip Glowy Balm,13-Dec-25,"I love this lip balm. Its more like a gloss. Feels great, not sticky at all and very moisturizing"
Lip Glowy Balm,13-Dec-25,"This stuff is amazing and is one of the few cosmetic items ill ¡°splurge¡± on. I normally get elf/maybelline/etc but my mom uses Laneige religiously and so I bought her this for a stocking stuffer Christmas 2024. She loves it so much and let me use some. Applies thick but so smooth, once its on you dont feel it heavy but it is doing what it needs to do. Looks so cute on but still suttle! Bought it again for this Christmas (25) and just know shell love it."
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,"Love Laneige products, this set is great!"
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,"This lip balm delivers impressive moisture without feeling heavy. The berry scent is subtle and refreshing, and the glossy finish leaves lips looking healthy and smooth. A reliable everyday lip essential"
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,Loved it so much and my boyfriend stole it! I had to buy two more so I will always have one around.
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,We love laneige lip products. Super hydrating and look great too. My daughters steal mine every time I get a new flavor/color!
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,Couldn¡¯t say enough good things about this gloss! It has lasted me so long and is the perfect tint!
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,"I have used the grapefruit one for years. Never tried the others because it worked. But as ARMY fan from BTS, I saw that JK uses the gummy bear one. I needed one for my car so why not? I love it. I love the formula already for not being sticky, more like slick oil. And the sweet candy smell is good. Is colorless, tasteless to me and it last a decent time like a balm not a big lip gloss. It's an every day lip product, and I reapply after eating mostly."
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,I love the consistency. It is sheer though
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,"Great, but overpriced. You could probably find the same ingredients and effectiveness in a korean brand for a third of the price. Also wouldn't be advertised by someone who sympathizes with a certain european historical figure's struggle."
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,"Super hydrating, adds a pretty shine, smooth feel, perfect for daily use."
Lip Glowy Balm,10-Dec-25,"I am absolutely obsessed with this lipgloss, I¡¯ve tried so many others including summer Fridays but I keep returning to this exact one. It has the perfect amount of light pink tint and actually hydrates your lips!! I¡¯ve probably gone through 10 tubes of this by now!"
Lip Glowy Balm,10-Dec-25,"Love this balm, very hydrating and soft"
Lip Glowy Balm,10-Dec-25,I love everything Laneige and this is no exception. A gift for my teen daughter - it got 2 thumbs up. We live in a dry climate and lips stay moisturized and smells good!
Lip Glowy Balm,09-Dec-25,"Comfortable and moisturizing balm. It's not sticky, but still lasts on the lips for awhile."
Lip Glowy Balm,09-Dec-25,THE BEST LIP GLOSS! I've tried everything and this gloss is in my top three!
Lip Glowy Balm,09-Dec-25,Didn¡¯t find anything special about this gloss. Price too high
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,Love all of these ! Best lip product
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,Dont buy into the hype. Its sticky and very very very lightly tinted. Tube is very small for $19. Smells good though.
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,"Smells great, doesn¡¯t stay on lips long, I have to reapply frequently. Nice shine without being sticky."
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,The best lip balm ever. I¡¯ve tried everything from Summer Fridays to aquaphor and I always come back to Laneige. All the flavors are good and it¡¯s not sticky. It looks good over lipstick and last a long time! This is probably my 12th time buying. I¡¯m not even embarrassed about it!!
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"I decided to try the LANEIGE Lip Glowy Balm in Gummy Bear after seeing Jungkook from BTS rave about it - if it's good enough for him, I figured it was worth a shot!
What I liked:
The scent is lovely and not overpowering, and the Gummy Bear shade gives a nice sheer tint of color. The texture feels smooth going on, and it has a lightweight, glossy finish. The packaging is sleek and easy to toss in a bag.
What didn't work for me:
I have really dry lips and was hoping this would be a game-changer, but I've only used it a few times since purchasing. For my level of dryness, it seems like this product needs consistent, frequent application to make a real difference. Since I often forget to reapply lip products throughout the day, I haven't seen the hydration results I was hoping for.
For comparison, I find that Vaseline Lip Therapy works better for my sporadic usage habits and delivers more intensive moisture when I need it. This LANEIGE balm also doesn't have much taste to it (which some might prefer, but I personally like a hint of flavor).
Bottom line:
If you're consistent with lip care and looking for a pretty, lightweight balm with a subtle tint, this could work well for you. For severely dry lips with inconsistent application, you might need something more heavy-duty."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"Hidrata bien, pero realmente no tiene color, solo es un brillo transparente bonito."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"For some reason this had like no scent at all. I have the berry scent and love it, but this smelt like literally nothing."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"When I first used this lip balm, I was very whelmed with its performance. It certainly did its job of hydrating my lips (without having to apply it 400 times a day), but I was unsure of whether its performance justified its price.

I neglected to remember that most products in the lip-care category are *checks notes* crap.

I was reminded of this fact when I misplaced this a little while back. While I tore up my living space looking for it, I got another lip balm, as being without lip care during the winter feels about as pleasant as falling down a flight of stairs. My replacement balm needed reapplication after 20 minutes, had a grainy texture, tasted horrible, and failed to do its one rudimentary task of hydrating my lips correctly. I eventually found my missing Laneige, and one application told me that it¡¯s 100% worth it (still try to get it on sale though).

It does the job its supposed to do, it doesn¡¯t need to be reapplied every three seconds, and less applications could make it more cost-effective to use in the long run. The flavor is also nice, but that doesn¡¯t matter as much as performance to me. I like products that work well, and seeing as I¡¯ve had this lip balm for two months and barely made a dent in the bottle (ignoring the fact that it spend a decent chunk of time being MIA), then this product may very well be joining my lineup of skincare staples."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"I did some research before buying this lip gloss, and it kept popping up as a top choice for a hydrating gloss that gives beautiful shine?and it totally lives up to the hype! I love how it makes my lips look fuller without any plumping effect, just a natural, fuller look. The formula is smooth and not at all sticky, which makes it super comfortable to wear.

It keeps my lips feeling hydrated for hours while giving them a lovely, glossy finish. It's become a daily go-to for me. If you're after a lip gloss that's moisturizing and gives that fuller look with a beautiful shine, this is definitely worth trying!"
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"This LANEIGE Lip Glowy Balm gives a sheer, pretty tint while keeping my lips soft and hydrated all day. The shea butter formula feels lightweight but really nourishing, and the shine makes my lips look instantly smoother."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,It really helps with chapped lips. It¡¯s never sticky or yucky on my lips. Makes my lips look so shiny and plump and just yesssss!!
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,This is a staple for me. I always have one in my bag and vanity.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Granddaughter loves it so I¡¯m happy
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Gave to granddaughter (29 yrs old) and she loves it. She has dry lips and loves soft color.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,I love this color ?? it¡¯s just enough pink for a casual day out!
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Love this product! Delivered in box no issues with presentation. Arrived in a timely manner from seller.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,My favorite lip balm ever. Lasts for hours.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Really great this duo is worth it can't wait to make another purchase
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Your lips look beautiful
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,"I¡¯m using this for a year, I love to purchase again"
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,This is the perfect gloss. Slight color tint. Not too sticky. Love!
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,This is a great daytime ¡°to go¡± version of the sleep mask. Lightweight and not sticky.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,So nice. It leave my lips with enough shine and it last a long time. There isn't a pink tint to it either
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Great lip balm however it is a bit overrated. Laniege a well known, popular brand that I like but it is not my favorite brand when it comes to lip products.

The product itself is cute and smells really good. The scent is one of the best things about it, the texture is very thick and velvety but sticky and too thick. It mosturizes my lips to a point but eventually it didn't make a difference. It may work differently depending on the skin type but it is still a good product I enjoy bringing around with me when I need it."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Lie this lip balm, gives my lip that pinky glossy look that I like. It last a pretty long time."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Me encanta brillo, no tiene color. Es s?per hidratante, huele muy bien y es de los mejores que he probado! Lo utilizo durante todo el a?o pero sobre todo en invierno y para dormir.. cuando despierto mis labios siguen hidratados. Lo ?nico malo es su precio¡¦ me parece excesivo."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"The tint is very, VERY sheer, but the balm is great quality. The flavor is light, not overwhelmingly sweet like balms for kids, but pleasant to wear. Keeps the lips nicely moisturized during the day, although I would recommend something heavier for winter weather or for overnight use. 9/10 and would buy again and again, definitely want to try the other flavors and tints!"
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"4 stars bc I love the vanilla and I love the formula of the lip masks and have bought them several times. However, BE WARNED: this brown lip mask is not sheer. It might look less awful on darker skin tones but on me (super pale) it looks like I've been eating... brown stuff."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,LOVE this balm! The formula is rich but not heavy leaving a fuller looking lips!
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Great lip balm, gives a beautiful glow on the lips."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,Love the sheet color. A little too soft so use care on how much pressure is used when applying. Great price.
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,One of my favorite lip balms
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,I love this. Keeps lips moist with a hint of color. I¡¯ve bought many for gifts.
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Love this balm, it doesn't iritate my lips."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"My absolute favorite lip gloss ever. It's thick enough that it stays on for a good amount of time but not overly thick that's it's too much. Just FYI, If you have long hair it will stick to your lips. It has the slightest hint of color. My go to over most, even my summer Friday's."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,22-Dec-25,"My daughter loves their lip products, and while she does like this gloss we were hoping it would be a little more pigmented, the color is extremely subtle."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,22-Dec-25,This lip serum really moisturizes and I love the color it is very subtle
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,22-Dec-25,Not sticky at all. Color is perfect and smells good.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,21-Dec-25,"Authentic and arrived perfectly, as listed and described."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,21-Dec-25,Not plumping if that¡¯s what you¡¯re looking for and slippery if you put too much but looks really good on.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Dec-25,"Love this lip serum! Perfect buildable color saturation, high gloss and excellent hydration. I also like that it does not have the ¡°fireball¡± sensation for the trending plumping effect that most glosses now have."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Dec-25,Me dije a mi misma que no comprar?a mas b?lsamos labiales y luego me top? con este!! De todos los que tengo (y tengo MUCHOS) este sin duda es mi favorito. Mis labios son secos como el desierto y este b?lsamo es el ?nico que realmente los hidrata. El olor es riqu?simo y la formula para nada pegajosa. Lo am?. ?????
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,19-Dec-25,"Smells great, rolls on smooth, subtle in color, makes lips nice and glossy."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,17-Dec-25,Donut shaped applicator makes it easy to apply the gloss ;)
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,15-Dec-25,"Love it, very nice color makes your lips look like you got a lip filler, hydradition is there, soft and Lucious, I love this it¡¯s great quality and size and everything."

Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Dec-25,Excellent glaze craze
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Dec-25,"This is one of my fav lip glosses by far! The smell of it is delicious! It leaves your lips soft and hydrated, not sticky! It doesn¡¯t last as long if you¡¯re drinking/eating. It gives that shine & love the color!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Dec-25,This product is by far my new favorite it makes your lips feel great ??
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,12-Dec-25,Gift for my daughter. This one is her favorite!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,LOVE IT AND IT LAST ALSO
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,"I bought the one called Maple syrup because I thought that was the coloring, I think it was but also I smell like I¡¯ve eaten pancakes every time I put it on my lips. Which is hilarious."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,"Literally smells like maple syrup! Or like I ate a maple bar lol. Super moisturizing and not too sticky. This keeps my lips hydrated and gives it a cute nude pink tint that still keeps the look subtle but can apply more of you want more gloss. A little goes a long way so I¡¯ve been able to keep it going throughout fall into winter. I love the little donut cushion applicator top too. Overall, great product even though a bit $$. I imagine I¡¯ll try the other shades/scents when I run out. For a medium neutral skin tone, I thought the maple glaze was perfect!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,Very hydraiting with the perfect touch of color
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Dec-25,I kept this in my car. Both my sisters went on a road trip with me and purchased as they were in the car. They loved it so much.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Dec-25,These glaze craze lippies are some of my favorites. I have in multiple flavors. Love them all
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Dec-25,"great applicator and packaging of the product!
the balm is moisturizing all day long and very nice on the lips.
the color is a bit light for medium to dark skin tone, would be a great nude lip for everyday use!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Dec-25,My teen granddaughter loves it¡¦ color is not too much for a 13 year old
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,I like this brand and their lip mask line so I was excited to try this out. It works fine and looks good on my skin tone (brown) but it was so sticky I felt like it was clumping most of the evening and I would wipe it off and reapply. I won't buy this again but I'm happy to use it till it runs out.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,Love this product! Would buy again when I¡¯m done. Just enough amount of moisturization and shine
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,I got the fake once so returned it .
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,Soft lips¡¦
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,Feels very nice in my lips. But it¡¯s a bit too pigmented for me. I have to do a small dot with another lip balm to get more of a subtly raspeberry look on my lips. I went to work early morning looking like a nuts case not realizing my lip gloss was everywhere and uneven lol
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,Moisturizing with the perfect gloss!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,It was not what I expected
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,Smells absolutely amazing! Loved the product and the color!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Dec-25,Smells incredible and exactly like chocolate frosting!!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Dec-25,Smells INCREDIBLE. I love this product.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"Really only ordered it for the color, but I was delighted to discover it softened my chapped lips better than most of my other balms! Winner. I have two now. Bonus, the flavors are excellent"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Love this! Nice soft color
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Best lip gloss on the market but it is HIGHLY pigmented. Just beware if you are only looking for something to stop lip chapping like I was!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"I have chocolate glaze and later bought cinnamon maple because it¡¯s soooo good. The colors are sophisticated, the perfect mixture of pigment to sheer. They give a nice blurr effect as well. Only downside is price and scent if you¡¯re picky"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Good
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Smells amazing and I would definitely repurchase
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"Love the applicator
Very limited - not a clear/light lip gloss"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"Nice color, not sticky and glides on well."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"The scent is really strong, and left me feeling nauseous. The color is beautiful, formula feels great and applicator very cool/effective. I¡¯m going to try to find a variation of this from Laneige but without scent. Such a pity."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"I love this color, especially for a light lip gloss that smells so good!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"It¡¯s a pretty color lip gloss , nothing special , liked the applicator"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"So cute, smells great, I think the price is a bit much but the jelly top is worth it! The gloss is thick and looks great. The lip gloss seems like it will have a nice longevity, the size is perfect for a pocket and the texture is nice and smooth."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love the shade and applicator! It smells good too. It doesn¡¯t last very long and it is a little sticky.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,"Beautiful color! Love the color on my lips, very sexy and this product keeps my lips hydrated."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love this stuff and the color is great. Not sticky and moisturizing. I¡¯m getting for all the girls in my family for chrismas!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love the pop of color and the way it feels. Keeps my lips hydrated and smooth in the dry winter months.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love this lip serum! Perfect fall shade . Would definitely buy again! I was glad to find it on sale!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,"Not a big fan. It goes on smooth and feels good for a little bit, but leaves your lips very dry. Not worth the money as it is not a cheap lip gloss."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,beautiful tint & very moisturizing for a lip gloss
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,"This is by far one of my favorite lip balms. The color is gorgeous, it¡¯s not sticky, and it lasts a long time. It also leaves your lips feeling super smooth. I highly recommend it!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,03-Dec-25,This gloss feels really good on and the color is subtle but definitely visible (not completely sheer).
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,03-Dec-25,"Good color and smell, but sits on top of my lips and not hydrating. When my lips starts to dry, it would outline my cracked lips ??"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,01-Dec-25,Product doesn't last on the lips and doesn't hydrate my lips at all. If anything I find that my lips get drier after using this product. Waste of money.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,30-Nov-25,I think it¡¯s okay not that great. The color is weird
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,29-Nov-25,I like this lip serum. It gives good moist .
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,28-Nov-25,"Really wasn't impressed for the price. My dermatologist recommended Laneige to me for all my lip care needs. I do use the lip sleeping mask and was really excited to try this lipgloss. Sadly, there really is no actual colored tint to the ""Strawberry Sprinkles"" and the shine wears off in less than an hour without even eating or drinking. I really had high hopes for this product considering the cost but it fell short. Definitely would not purchase again unless at a steep discount.
Side note: It isn't sticky on your lips and is easy to apply and comfortable with the rolling lip ball. I just prefer more shine and a subtle pink tint which I have found with cheaper brands."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,28-Nov-25,Great lip gloss !
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,27-Nov-25,My favorite lip product. The color is perfect and it smells so good! Doesn¡¯t leave residue or that white ring some glosses do.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,26-Nov-25,Granddaughter loved
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,24-Nov-25,"This is worse than drug store gloss. Thin and over priced, just useless."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,23-Nov-25,good
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,21-Nov-25,Love this product
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Nov-25,Was a present for a preteen she loved it
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Nov-25,"Love this color, will buy it again! ????"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,19-Nov-25,S?per suave e hidrata
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,18-Nov-25,"I have tried almost every lip gloss, oil, serum. They are sticky, smell odd, need constant reapplication. This tinted serum is beautiful. It goes on without an applicator which let's be honest, you contaminant the product every time it's put back in tube. Laneige's new tinted lip serum in cinnamon sugar is BEAUTIFUL, NONSTICKY, leaves my lips COMFORTABLE, soft and the simmery but not that cheap glitter goop. You won't know it's on because it's a serum!! I'll NEVER SWITCH."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,17-Nov-25,"I¡¯m a big fan of Laneige, and this product is no exception."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,17-Nov-25,"Great go-to for light-to-medium glossy coverage. I like how it applies ? it¡¯s ¡°thick¡± enough so that you can see the color on the tube and on your lips, but it¡¯s not an overwhelmingly goopy consistency or opaque color."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,15-Nov-25,Very nice.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,15-Nov-25,"Very moisturizing, smells like chocolate, easy to apply. Leaves a nice shine initially but I do have to reapply throughout the day."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Nov-25,"This is a treatment balm disguised as a color balm. It gives a glassy shine, complete hydration for hours, and has a scent that makes you think of cinnamon buns. Ohhh my¡¦ yum. I¡¯ve ordered two shades now and adore both."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Nov-25,"Left my lips so dry, I needed a moisture stick to comfort them"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Nov-25,"I really like the color and how it feels on. Not sticky. I wish they had left the applicator alone. It is flat now, used to be at an angle and you could control the amount more easily."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Nov-25,"GREAT smell & color!

Worst gloss applicator ever! Why, why, why?"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Nov-25,Instant hydration and a nice tint.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Nov-25,"Every winter my lips dry out and they Crack, bleed, I get cuts at the corner of my mouth, dry season is horrible. I've tried a lot of other brands and it always feels ""too light"". But I bought this on a whim since I was pretty desperate. I am sooooo surprised that even though the formula is still light, it ACTUALLY penetrates my lips and makes it feel so comfortable and stretchy again. I love the smell too. I actually bought a second one because of how much better I felt and my lips healing.

I still use Aquafor and Vaseline of course, but dang this product is like an immediate relief. It helps with the pain of my lips too. The color is beautiful as well.

I'm just so glad I bought it, literally helped me so much. I can't believe I didn't buy it sooner.

Next year I am def just buying these ahead of time.

My lips still get dry (it is just ingrained in em) but dabbing this one brings immediate relief, color, and makes the pain go away."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Nov-25,"The cutest light sheer lip gloss with a little pink tint, tastes good, applicator feels nice. Love it"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,The pigment separated from the gloss. Half of the tube had no pigment and went on clear with no tiny. Very disappointing for the price. Will not purchase again.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,"The best. moisturizing, the scent and tint are great. not too much color, but just enough. lips have a light glaze not fried chicken greasy. perfect. this is my 5th tube. I bought one for every handbag and laptop case and keep one in the glove compartment of my car."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,Love this gloss. Moisturizing and a pretty sheer color. Not sticky. Smells great too.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,"I tried LANEIGE Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum Strawberry Sprinkles and found the color far too clear?didn¡¯t provide the tint I expected. The formula is also very goopy and feels heavy on the lips. Despite the hydrating and plumping claims, it wasn¡¯t comfortable to wear, and I wouldn¡¯t buy it again."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,This is my new favorite lip glaze! The color is natural and beautiful. It hydrates my lips and adds some shine. I carry one in my purse for touch ups during the day. Somehow it adds moisture and just enough shine without being sticky.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,She¡¯s a queen and she¡¯s so beautiful on the lips. Just a light touch of baby pink and so moisturizing
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,Love this !
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,"This lip serum has a pretty color and gives a nice glossy finish without feeling sticky, which I really like. It feels lightweight and comfortable to wear, and the tint looks natural and flattering.
The only downside is that it¡¯s not as hydrating as I hoped, especially for something marketed as a lip serum. It¡¯s still a nice gloss overall, but I wish it provided a little more moisture."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,I recently discovered Laneige and have figured out why it has such great reviews!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,Drys my lips out little bit ¡¦ taste isn¡¯t bad shimmery and a pop of color is perfect
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,"A little expensive, but a little goes along way. Keep lips moistened and soft. The flavors are great too."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,Love the applicator and formula
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,"Me encant? todo, desde el olor hasta la textura del silicon que trae en el aplicador. El color es igual y si se siente los labios hidratados. Cumple con su funci?n y vale la pena su precio."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,Certifiably obsessed with this lip gloss!!!!!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,Great product
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Nov-25,Very pretty girly packaging. The glaze lip serum gently tints your lips and the color stays on a very long time without making your lips feel dry or sticky.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Dec-25,Products smaller than expected but smell nice.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Dec-25,"It's a nice moisturizer. I wouldn't say it's exactly ""plumping"" or anything magical like that. Decent fair quality, moderate hydration and somewhat soft feeling set. The texture is creamy and super light. J do have to layer with a thicker moisturizer over winter."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Dec-25,Love this set great value!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Dec-25,I was given the caramel lip sleeping mask as a gift and Laniege has a new customer!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Dec-25,"So small,"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Dec-25,I have never tried a Laneige product that I didn¡¯t like! And this was no different the minis were super cute and work great! The masks and lip balm are both super hydrating!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Dec-25,great for gifts
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,20-Dec-25,The box says full size but the only product full size is the tube. I was very disappointed in the tiny pot.

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,Its a fun product and colors are on point it really gives a fuller lip look
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,Very cute and a great gift for Christmas.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,"Never a disappointment !! Great for sensitive skin. No strong fragrance
I have all full sizes and i bought this to travel"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,I bought this as a gift but I loveeee laneige lip care and the recipient loved the gift!! She said her lips were chapped going to bed and they woke up completely healed and soft! Highly recommend!

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,17-Dec-25,This is such a cute set and it was on sale and very affordable. My teen daughter will love it.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,17-Dec-25,"I love this brand I love the flavor mix (chocolates a little different, but not bad). I actually really like the mini tubes because they¡¯re so easy to carry around. Eggnog and caramel are actually so good."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,16-Dec-25,Love this brand. The bouncy firm line is amazing and my skin looks and feels great.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,16-Dec-25,"I was excited to get this set to use as Christmas gifts but they are super extra mini. I have a previous mini version of the lip sleeping mask and it¡¯s 8g-these are only 3g and the packaging looks very cheap. (Below you can see the mint is the old mini size and the brown is the one just rcvd)
The new ones are tiny and less than half full at that with completely hollow bottoms. I¡¯m returning because I thought I got a good deal but now it feels like a rip off."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,"Not bad , but super small for the price , wouldn¡¯t buy again ."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,You dont see it but at the bottom they obviously filled it to such a small amount. I dont know how to explain it but i attached a photo. Very good products though!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,Be aware these are very small sizes. Not sure I would recommend.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,Muy refrescante e hidratan durante el d?a y la noche
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,I love this product and use it every night all year. It keeps my lips soft and the tubs go a long way. It tastes like peppermint/ candy cane.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,"Best way to try these lip mask and glowy balms. I try each flavor so much, hot chocolate was my favorite. I love the smaller sizes and really enjoy the way my lips feel after use."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,Honestly not worth it
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,Great product for price
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"Bought for my friend, her granddaughter, and, of course, myself! Laneige lip masks are my go to every night, and the fun flavors makes it a treat, plus I wake up with conditioned lips."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"She loves this it's small ,but great for her"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"What a joke! These are SUPER EXTRA TINY sample sizes meant for 2-3 uses, especially the lip masks! They are deceiving in the photos. The product is way less than the actual container it comes in! And they have the nerve to have the original price be at $21? I see that greed has no limits nowadays. I am honestly disgusted with this company right now. Wont be ordering their products ever again."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"I honestly loved this set and would absolutely buy it again, but I do want to note that the products are not full sized so buyers are aware. Even so, everything inside feels high quality and perfect for everyday self care, especially if you already like Laneige products or want to try them before committing to full sizes. The lip mask is super hydrating and makes a noticeable difference overnight, the lip glowy balm is perfect for daily use without feeling sticky, and the Water Bank moisturizer feels lightweight but still very moisturizing. All of the products work really well together and made my skin and lips feel soft, smooth, and taken care of. The packaging is also really cute which makes it great for gifting, but it is just as good to keep for yourself. Overall this is a solid set that actually delivers and feels like a treat without being overhyped."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,13-Dec-25,Nice gift for tween granddaughters.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,13-Dec-25,Originally bought for my friend as part of her gift well worth it for what all comes in it will be purchasing again
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,12-Dec-25,"I haven't tried much products from Laniege, but I will always repurchase their lip mask. Applying before bed and your lips feel so hydrated and plump the next morning.
I love that this kit has two styles of applications. I take the tube to go and leave the other one on my nightstand. Scents are also amazing. This one leave a nice minty tingle on the lips. Not overpowering at all."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,11-Dec-25,"Good variety to try the different scents, but I don¡¯t think it¡¯s a good value overall at all. It¡¯s almost all packaging. For how long it took to get it was actually really disappointing."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,11-Dec-25,My favorite products of all time.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,10-Dec-25,Received exactly as shown.

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,Perfect holiday lip kit. My 13 year old loves it!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,I always buy these mini sets instead of the large tub since it's around the same price but you get a larger variety of flavors. This one is perfect for winter so I can swap out some fruity chapstick with spiced eggnog or chocolate instead!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,"I bought these kits on a Black Friday sale at the urging of my sister, who bought it and loved it. I bought one for myself and two as gifts. I'm seriously considering keeping them all for myself - they're THAT good."

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,"This duo is complete! It matches so well. The scent is strong and reminds you of Christmas time which you can¡¯t go wrong with.

It¡¯s a gift so I couldn¡¯t say much more than the flavor and package.

The package was small enough to wrap and ship. The price was great for a combo package of two items."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,Great price
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,Came as advertised for a Christmas gift.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,Excellent lip items. It Works & smells great.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,Product isn¡¯t bad but they are TINY!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,"This little set is great, my daughter will be thrilled for Christmas! It comes with flavors she likes and they are the perfect size to throw in a bag. Great price also!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,Dope af
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,07-Dec-25,"Purchase for my daughter as a Christmas gift so we have not opened it, but I was pleased with the sale price during Black Friday and she loves these products so I think she will be very happy with them"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,07-Dec-25,I get these every single year at Christmas time because it¡¯s my favorite scent in this lipgloss/lipbam. So I buy enough to last me throughout the year. I¡¯m extremely passionate about this product and I would recommend it to anyone that loves minty lip treatments. It¡¯s also a phenomenal value.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,07-Dec-25,Perfect Christmas gift for my daughter who is obsessed with all things beauty and skin care. The price was great! She will be happy Christmas morning.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,Nicely packaged. As expected
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,"I loooove their lip masks and this set did not disappoint! The smells are amazinggg however the pots are very very small. I know it¡¯s obvious, but I was a little surprised when i finished it within a week."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,"Bought it for a family member, she has used the same brand/product before and likes it. Package arrived as promised and in good condition, not much more to say."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,Great skincare
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,05-Dec-25,"I love this brand, it¡¯s long lasting and it moisturizes very good !"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,05-Dec-25,I love the variety of scents in this kit. It feels like a luxury kit. It makes an excellent gift.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,05-Dec-25,"I enjoy the sugar scrub and lip sleeping mask. The lip scrub doesn't seem to fully get rid of the dry skin. Scrub is overall smooth to apply, smells good and isn't gritty like others."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,This is a great product and the gift set is awesome!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,"My lips really dry out, especially in the winter and I've tried so many lip masks and overnight balms even the high end brands that really didn't work that well, so I was truly blown away when I tried this one. I went for the holiday scent but I'm really impressed and excited at how well this product actually worked. I use the lip mask at night and wake up with my lips still moist and I use the balm over blotted lipstick in these cold months to keep my lips from chapping during these cold temp days (typically my lip gloss works well for me most of the year, but can't keep up in the winter). Also, love that it's not sticky. Goes on smooth and lips feel great. Happy to have survived winter so far WITHOUT chapped lips!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,"The lip balm are somewhat moisturizing and have a pleasant scent, but I experience a lot of dread skin buildup with this product. I prefer Mario Badescu lip balm to this as it's more moisturizing and I never have dead skin buildup. I really wanted to like this product but I won't be purchasing again."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,great deal high quality mini products
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,"Nice lip care, great smell."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,"Love this gift set. I broke it up and put these into little gift bags for my co-workers. They LOVED them!

I got to save one for myself (the caramel one) and I am obsessed. Smells heavenly and does a good job keeping my lips moisturized! Also, I adore how tiny and precious each lip mask/balm is."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,"Moisturizing, smells good, and tastes good! I love Laniege and this is a great gift or stocking stuffer!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,The package was a lot smaller then the original picture on Amazon but the product is overall amazing
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,"Perfect packaging for a Christmas gift. The products are nice, even if the sizes are small, but the price is reasonable for gifting. It looks great and feels thoughtful."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,I love !! Everything is so tiny and cute. The lip mask are perfect for the winter. Chapped lips before bed? Put a good amount on and like nothing in the morning !! Sometimes I wear the mask through the day too specially in the winter months.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,Great value for the money. Love that it¡¯s discounted further with subscribe and save. Keep it stocked for teen gifts.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,Cute set and the price was right.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,Bien
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,My daughters all time favorite
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,I loved this
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,01-Dec-25,"These are MINI mini products. Like sample size. I saw that these were on sale for $16 and I've been wanting to try some other flavors so I went for it. I was shocked at how tiny the package was. The product itself is ok but the size for what we're paying for is silly. The sleep mask container is hollowed out underneath so you're only getting like a 1/4 tsp of product. Also the applicator for the glowy balm is hard plastic, not silicone like the full size product so it sucks to put the product on. Overall just super disappointed with the amount and the quality that we get in this package. I wouldn't recommend purchasing for this price."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,"The Laneige lip product I received arrived opened, used, and had writing on the packaging. This is not acceptable for a cosmetic item and raises hygiene concerns."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,Great for gifts!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,One of THE holiday gift items for tween girls.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,Great product! The jars of product are deceiving as the amount of product is half of the jar. Would buy again for the quality
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,29-Nov-25,"The products I received didn't help my lips at all. For 3 weeks I used the chocolate night cream every night and the vanilla cream several times a day. The chocolate cream stained my pillowcase and the vanilla cream felt like thin petroleum jelly. My lips were as dry as ever. After 3 weeks I went back to using my old lip balm.

Maybe I received a bad batch or a fake."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,29-Nov-25,Great gift and got it on sale. Super excited to give this to my friend for Christmas.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,A lot smaller than I thought but this will still last you months and is worth the price
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,La marca es genial
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,I loved the way they all applied and I think it¡¯s a good price for all the stuff in the package
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,I absolutely love these lip balms and masks! I also got them cheaper on here so it¡¯s totally worth it.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,25-Nov-25,"I've purchased the other nighttime lip masks from Laneige and have loved them, but this wasn't the winner for me. I don't really like chocolatey flavored lip care items -- ""brighter"" and fruitier flavors are for sure my preference so I will return to that. I was excited to try their ""daytime"" gloss but it's sticky and wears away quickly."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,24-Nov-25,"Both my daughter and I love the Laneige lip products! She wears the sleep mask every night and it¡¯s really helped keep her lips smooth and unchapped, especially since our climate is so dry! The peppermint scent is soft and not overwhelming. We even buy this as a great gift for her tween friends!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Nov-25,Using this set as a prize during our Christmas party games! Great product and pricng!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Nov-25,I love it perfect for traveling and having it at home it lasts for such a long time and a little goes a long way it has great pricing and is just an amazing product
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,It is more like a sample pack.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,This is the greatest skin care I have used.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,Love all the Laneige products.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,"I always question when I see products advertised by influencers, but this is the real deal. Love it love it love it."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Nov-25,Bought when it was on sale and used it for my bridesmaid proposal gifts!
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Dec-25,I bought this on a whim and it is a game changer. 'Pore Blurring' = Filter IRL. Definitely worth the purchase price and just makes me feel real cute. Softens too bronze/blushed areas of my face.
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Dec-25,"This powder is absolutely incredible! I never write reviews, but I am just blown away. I have mature skin and I have been using the same powder for at least 20 years. I decided to try this after having seen a news article. It sets my foundation with a matte finish while blurring pores and fine wrinkles. It doesn¡¯t add color and keeps my makeup from looking caked. I love it!"
Neo Blurring Powder,16-Dec-25,My holy grail! Definitely the best blurring powder I tried so far.
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Dec-25,"I don't know why but I wasn't expecting this to be a white loose powder. For some reason I thought it was more of a solid even though the description does say powder. That said, it's like cornstarch, it definitely creates a very matte effect but it should be used sparingly because otherwise it looks weird."
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Dec-25,This stuff is magic. Keeps my skin looking shine free all day. It¡¯s also easy to just throw in your bag if a touch up is needed.
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Dec-25,Worked good but I couldn't handle the smell I gave it away
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Dec-25,"I didn¡¯t use powder before, and my concealer used to crease into fine lines. That¡¯s no longer an issue with this. The finish looks very natural, and I also stay less shiny by the end of the day. Very happy with it."
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Dec-25,"Powder is so soft and smooth, I¡¯ll definitely buy it again when I run out!"
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Dec-25,"Overall a pretty good powder. The packaging is cool, but beyond the novelty of the dispenser, it's not too special. The powder looks alright, and it's not too overly drying."
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Dec-25,"I use this any day that I wear makeup now. If you have shiny or oily skin, give this a try."
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Dec-25,Leaves a plastic film feeling on my face without controlling any shine- a plus it even breaks me out!
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Dec-25,"Great blurring powder but the method of delivery is terrible. Pushing on the soft mesh screen does nothing. You have to turn the compact over and tap it onto the puff. Good product, terrible packaging."
Neo Blurring Powder,09-Dec-25,I¡¯m surprised this has such good reviews- it caused creasing around my eyes that I don¡¯t have when I use other powders
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Dec-25,"This powder delivers on its blurring promise - it really does create a smooth, airbrushed finish on the skin.
Dispenser concerns:
The push-down dispenser mechanism is a bit nerve-wracking to use. I never quite know how much product will come out when I press, which makes it tricky to avoid waste or getting too much powder at once. It takes some practice to get the feel for it.
I also can't see how much product remains in the compact, so I have no idea when I'll actually need a replacement. You're basically flying blind until it suddenly runs out.
The puff:
The included puff is wonderfully soft and fluffy, which feels nice on the skin. However, since I'm using this as a finishing powder over foundation, the puff picks up my foundation color pretty quickly. You'll likely want to wash it regularly or have a backup puff on hand.
Performance & portability:
No white cast, which is great (though full disclosure - I'm not very tanned, so those with deeper skin tones should test this). The compact is nicely sized for travel - small enough to slip into any bag without taking up much space.
Bottom line:
The blurring effect is fantastic and the compact size is convenient, but the dispensing system could use some improvement. If you can get past the learning curve with the dispenser, it's a solid finishing powder for touch-ups throughout the day."
Neo Blurring Powder,06-Dec-25,I'd love to buy it again!
Neo Blurring Powder,04-Dec-25,I luv this and it deserves more love from influencers
Neo Blurring Powder,04-Dec-25,"I¡¯m not a big makeup person, but I tried so many other brands and this one is so far the best one I¡¯ve ever tried. I¡¯m very impressed."
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Nov-25,"Y¡¯all!!! There¡¯s magic in this little thing!!! I swear! This blurring powder will take five years off your face in 15 seconds. I¡¯ve been through my share. I¡¯m a total makeup junkie- (it¡¯s a problem) and the results are almost unbelievable. I¡¯m trying so hard not to sound like a 1-800-Call-Now and I know I¡¯m failing. Feel free to laugh, but push that ¡°Buy Now¡± button as fast as you can!

The compact design itself is really fantastic too. Someone actually thought ahead and realized this would be tossed in a purse, bag, whatever.

The little silicone mesh part is just cool and dispenses the perfect amount. It¡¯s nice to stop spilling powder everywhere and wasting product. I wish everything powder came like this.
You NEED this, whether you¡¯re in the market for blurring powder or not.
Absolutely fantastic."
Neo Blurring Powder,29-Nov-25,Very nice powder. Works well.
Neo Blurring Powder,27-Nov-25,"Does not blur anything. Would not recommend for women over 35. It shows every line. Also, not a fan of the packaging, really hard to get the powder evenly out."
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Nov-25,This is my favorite blurring powder!
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Nov-25,"the powder is great, but the carrying clip-on bit makes it so you can't open the powder. kinda defeats the purpose"
Neo Blurring Powder,25-Nov-25,Really makes a difference. Like a little subtle filter. No coverage but makes bare skin prettier and nice over foundation.
Neo Blurring Powder,21-Nov-25,This powder was quite subtle and took away any oily looks after applying foundation. I was pleasantly surprised. Worth the price!
Neo Blurring Powder,20-Nov-25,"Absorbs oil well, but looks too powdery on my skin."
Neo Blurring Powder,19-Nov-25,"Nothing special. It's really a green-tinted loose powder that is probably intended to mute red tones. I don't think that works. If you want to carry around a very cute compact of loose powder in your purse, you may like it. I like the loose powder from IT Cosmetics a lot more than this because it helps to conceal pores."
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Nov-25,Loved this powder. My favorite thing about it is how easy it is to travel with it. It has a unique dispenser that only is supposed to dispense when you press on it. I've traveled with mother powders that are so messy after being knocked around. This does do a very good job setting and blurring.
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Nov-25,LOVE how well this blurs my pores! My pores are so large! This helps make them disappear or appear smaller depending on the day. Not cake like at all and is easy to remove. I need to actually get a refill soon I have been using it so much! I love the Laneige line anyways for cleaning my face and moisturizer so I am excited that it is a product made by them because I trust them.
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Nov-25,Me encanta!!!!
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Nov-25,"I have combination skin type. My T zone ( forehead, nose and chin area) are oily and rest of my face is dry. This powder keeps my oily area nice and matt all day long and doesn¡¯t dry out my cheeks or eye area. Perfect for everyday use. They made this powder so convenient to use at home or on the go. I highly recommend to everyone or all skin type"
Neo Blurring Powder,16-Nov-25,Absolutely the best product!!! I don¡¯t have any shine all day long and it doesn¡¯t look like a flat matte face. So impressed that I¡¯ve thrown away all my other high-price facial powders?I will be only using this Laneige powder.
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Nov-25,f?rmula is great but the packaging has a mesh thing that makes it hard to get the product evenly on the applicator
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Nov-25,"This seems to work pretty well - I don't seem as shiny afterwards! I like the little poof used to apply the product, although it's kind of hard to handle with the little strap. Overall, this is a great product, and I will definitely use it frequently!"
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Nov-25,Love it - flawless finish!
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Nov-25,"Horrible. I have oily tan skin and this barely removes the oil and leaves more of a white residue. Don't waste your money, there are better products out there."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"I bought this because of all the great reviews, so I think that maybe it's just me...

The powder does not dispense easily, which is annoying. Also... I see NO difference in my face with vs. without it. My face is not oily, but I do have issues with my pores on my nose and chin."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,This is ok but it doesn¡¯t control oil well or blur much but it¡¯s a decent enough setting powder
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,This stuff is literally magic for us oily-skinned gals. It soaks the oil right off the face and you¡¯re left shine free! Highly recommend.
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"I don't know if I would consider this revolutionary but it is a decent, fine powder and I appreciate the compact which makes it convenient and easy to travel with. It does do a decent job of blurring pores as well."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,Great powder
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,Great product. Really helps my skin and helps with my make up application.
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,Does a great job blurring. I have not worn long enough to know how it settles but it¡¯s been good so far.
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"Expensive and honestly, not sure this does anything. I have something similar that cost nine dollars from target and I would buy that over and over again before I bought this again."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"Like it and really helped with keeping the makeup in place and no shine but the cushion that comes with it gets stained so quickly with foundation and after a wash, the material wasn¡¯t as soft anymore."
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Nov-25,"I really love this face powder!
A bit expensive but totally worth it!"
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Nov-25,Amazing amazingly smooth and fine powder. Goes on nicely feels soft to the touch
Neo Blurring Powder,09-Nov-25,Love it! Blurs perfectly. I would definitely buy again
Neo Blurring Powder,08-Nov-25,Magic !!!! I¡¯d but stock in this product
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Nov-25,"This powder helps keep my oiliness away for a bit longer than without it. However, I do not like the way this powder looks on me. I tried over and under my foundation, less, more, setting spray before and/or after, different setting sprays, as a setting powder, baking, and it just always looks weird. Idk, I¡¯ll keep trying though till it¡¯s gone but I do not have high hopes."
Neo Blurring Powder,05-Nov-25,The puff came already used. I was disgusted.
Neo Blurring Powder,05-Nov-25,No different than any other translucent powder. Oily skin will come through between applications
Neo Blurring Powder,03-Nov-25,"I just received it today. The first thing I noticed was that the packaging was open, but I assumed it was just from transport. I was really disappointed to see that the applicator it came with had tan discoloration as if it was previously used for applying foundation, concealer, etc. The powder part was still sealed but I¡¯m still skeptical about the integrity of the product considering its state when I received it."
Neo Blurring Powder,03-Nov-25,Was an amazing product full coverage and totally blurring
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Nov-25,"The powder itself did reduce shine better than other brands, but it's because it's extra drying. Look at my pic how this powder dried out my skin around my mouth with lots of peeling.

I have dry skin that always produces extra oil so I have to blot all day. I used the same skincare (La Mer cream) and sunscreen. The only item I used differently was the Laneige powder. With La Mer cream being on the greasy side, Laneige powder still dried out my skin badly. This powder itself is a great product if it doesn't dry you out.

However, the packaging is really bad. It releases only a little bit of loose powder onto the small puff extremely unevenly, making application spotty and ineffective, and makes the puff dirty from foundation. It'll be much better if this powder comes in a typical loose powder container or in a pressed powder compact. Either is better than this packaging."
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Nov-25,"I wish I tried this sooner! This is PERFECT for people like me who have perpetually oily foreheads. The best product for oil control. After applying, it leaves the skin with an interesting texture, which isn¡¯t a bad thing, just an observation. I used to use the Laura Mercier setting powder, but this is leagues ahead! I love that there¡¯s a spot for the puff in the packaging."
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Nov-25,"I had high hopes for this product, but the texture is not great on two types of liquid makeup and as a setter for BB cream. The pad wasted more product than what actually made it to my face."
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Oct-25,This product is amazing and makes my skin look flawless!
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Oct-25,"Bought this due to an influencer video that I follow. I like most of her recommended products, but not this one. I gave 3 stars because I do like the compact design. There is a barrier between the powder and the puff so it doesn't go everywhere. I purchased the translucent, but it makes my skin look very dull. I would not recommend this product."
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Oct-25,The puff that came with it is discolored with someone else's foundation (see picture).
Neo Blurring Powder,25-Oct-25,"Fair performance, it does blot out shine and pores but not any better than regular powders for less money"
Neo Blurring Powder,24-Oct-25,As someone who has struggled with oily skin this has been such a wonderful find. It most definitely helps and I can highly recommend it. Gives a nice clean finish without a matte look.
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Oct-25,"It seems like a nice product. Leaves skin soft.
I don¡¯t think it¡¯s hypoallergenic though. I do have lots of environmental allergies, but most make up I have never have a problem with. Every time I use this powder, even just on my chin, my eyes itched and watered and burned. I ended up giving it to my daughter. Just something to consider."
Neo Blurring Powder,20-Oct-25,"It's face powder. I read the hype and I am disappointed. I thought it would cover my face, somehow miraculously.
It actually was worse coverage compared to other face powders I have used."
Neo Blurring Powder,19-Oct-25,Definitely does its job! ??
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Oct-25,Product I received was clearly used. Opened the first time and the puff had product embedded. Disgusting.
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Oct-25,"Stays matte, little goes a long way"
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Oct-25,I am satisfied with the quality of the product
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Oct-25,very matte and smoothing I'm surprised how blurring it is!
Neo Blurring Powder,16-Oct-25,This product really works well. No wrinkles!
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Oct-25,"The product doesn't get on the provided puff that well and in my experience, you have to kind of add a lot for prominent results which is fine."
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Oct-25,"oh wow! This powder is pure witchery. I have no idea how or what¡¦ but it makes my face a perfect palette. My skin looks so even and pretty. I only wear a little makeup- some under eye concealer, blush, highlighter and tinted lip gloss. but this powder makes me makeup look even better. I used to think the natural dew-y look was the way to go, but this smooth matte finish is way cuter, mostly because my skin tone looks more even and my face looks polished. When you press the puff into the compact you even wonder if anything is coming out. But clearly something is working! Love it so much."
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Oct-25,"Its good. I love the puff that comes with it, and appreciate the creative packaging. Powder is a tough one, but they figured it out. It goes on smooth, but I don't love the way it sits over my foundation. It could just be that my Makeup Forever foundation doesn't mix well with this powder, but it leaves me looking a little cakey and settles into my fine lines."
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Oct-25,You¡¯re not kidding in the blurring. This stuff is witchcraft in the best possible way. I¡¯m 52 and it wears in my skin well. I¡¯m a huge follower of the Laneige brand of which I started with the lip mask and oh those are amazing as well ladies!
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Oct-25,Didn¡¯t see much of a difference was not a fan of the product and left my skin blocthy
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Oct-25,"10/5 stars for my oily face! It's a beautiful powder that sets my makeup without looking cakey. It keeps my face looking smooth and blurred for much, much longer than any other powder I've used before. I'm glad I finally decided to take a chance on it because it's been worth it for me.

I prefer to use the cushion to pick up the powder and then use a brush to pick up the powder from the cushion because it keeps the cushion from getting gunked up with oils and makeup residue, which cuts down on how often I need to wash the cushion.

If you struggle with your face becoming shiny after just a couple of hours, this is the powder for you. It's not expensive when you compare it to high end Western powders, plus you can get refills for it.

The packaging is lovely, designed well, feels great to hold and use, and makes the product portable. However the box and the compact didn't come with a tamper-proof safety seal (see my pics). I was a bit apprehensive about it. I looked it up and it's apparently just how they package and ship this product. I think it's sensible to add safety seals to all beauty products, but I'll get over it because I love this powder. The powder itself has a type of seal over it (which comes with a short set of instructions) to keep the powder from falling out, but I wouldn't call that seal tamper-proof."
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Oct-25,"This powder is amazing.
I use it as a setting AND finishing powder.
I have very very VERY oily skin.
Makeup stays put ALL day!
When my oils start to seep through I use blotting sheets and everything is still perfect after blotting.
My skin looks and feels like velvet.
I am very impressed.
The compact is cute and I appreciate that I can buy a refill of the powder.
Excellent."
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Oct-25,"After using it a couple of times, I¡¯m obsessed. It makes my skin look so smooth and matte without feeling dry, and it really does blur my pores. The puff is super soft and applies the product evenly. I¡¯ve actually been reaching for this way more than my Givenchy Libre Prism powder. Love this find and love the Laneige brand even more now. I find the price point to be more than fair considering the quality, lightweight consistency, and results."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Oct-25,Can't believe how well this worked to control shine and keep my makeup fully in place! Went to a wedding and would've usually ended up sweaty/shiny...my makeup looks like it did at the start of the night. I have oily/combination skin and this is the only product that's ever kept me from getting shiny by the end of the night
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Oct-25,I really like the powder but I actually didn't like the container. works great at first but as you use up product it gets harder getting product out. I cut mine open because I thought it was almost empty and it was like half full.
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,Love this stuff!!! Great for older skin!
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,"If I put it on and take a photo it's very visible in the photo. I don't like the material of the sponge that comes with the powder, it feels like it'll retain powder and bacteria significantly more than other options. It's also difficult to get powder when I want to use it, but it easily spilled in my drawer, where it was sitting upright correctly, and the drawer only opens pulled out. That was concerning that I had powder spilled in the drawer and on my hands when I pulled it out. I do like that there's a separate spot for the sponge to sit while it's put away. I prefer a different power I purchased from a different Korean brand."
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,Really doesn¡¯t work
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,"Wow, can't say enough. Packaging makes this powder a breeze and not a giant mess.
I have oily/combo skin, and was not patchy or drying. Helped with my fine lines, lasted around 8-10 hours on my skin and was easily able to touchup with the little fluffy pouf it comes with.
I will be re-purchasing because the formula, either under or over my foundation, works great! There is no white cast, and works great with brushes or sponges. I also use it to set my eyeshadows, and it's so light that there is no movement and my eyeshadows look great all day.
I'm picky and sensitive with packed powder/loose powder - and this can function as both!"
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,Where has this been all my life?!!! Works perfectly to blur makeup and give an oil free appearance! Worth every penny!! Get it!!
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Oct-25,"Where has this been all my life. My skin is fairly oily, and I apply this every morning after my foundation, and my makeup lasts all day with 0 touchups."
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Oct-25,Cute little case (like if Apple designed and powder compact). It holds the puff away from the powder. Case is a little fat but it¡¯s cute. Not a whole lot of powder but the mechanism works well for dispensing loose powder without making a huge mess.
Neo Blurring Powder,06-Oct-25,This stuff is fantastic! Kept my makeup looking fresh all day through the humid Florida summer. Love how it takes the shine out of my face and lightly blurs my pores. Forever part of my daily routine.
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Oct-25,This line is really awesome. I love the blurring powder and the sleeping masks!!!!!
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Sep-25,"It¡¯s pricey for a powder but case is pretty and compact. Powder last long and very silky
travel friendly overall satisfying!"
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Sep-25,"Doesn¡¯t blur so much as just give a white cast to the skin. It does absorb oil! If that is your only concern, it¡¯s fine. But if you¡¯re anything other than a porcelain complexion, probably not for you. I¡¯m white, by the way, but a *little* tan from summer I guess?"
Neo Blurring Powder,29-Sep-25,This is a MUST HAVE for oily skin! Love this product and use it daily to help keep my shine under control!
Neo Blurring Powder,29-Sep-25,This powder works wonders to control oil in the summer months. It is way too drying to use in the winter or dry months though. Oh and a little bit goes a long way.
Neo Blurring Powder,28-Sep-25,This product works well! I like that it doesn't change the color of your other makeup or powders when applying. It controls oil and very light weight!
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Sep-25,This is the holy grail of setting powders and I love the packaging
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Sep-25,"This order was used packaged like it was new, but when opened, it was clearly used. The sponge was dirty with foundation and the mirror had powder on it. Gross."
Neo Blurring Powder,23-Sep-25,Came in with a broken closing mechanism and wouldn¡¯t close. The product itself is ok though takes multiple applications and it¡¯s hard to get an even distribution on the puff.
Neo Blurring Powder,23-Sep-25,"This powder is sort of like witchcraft! It really does what it says, and that just a light application provides beautiful blurring and modifying of the skin. It¡¯s very light, and looks great even on my 50+ year-old skin. It does not accentuate creases or lines at all. Will definitely be buying this product again"
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Sep-25,Not sure what the hype is with this brand and this powder. Bought because I saw it and it looked convincing but I will return to IT blurring powder. Works better for me. It's hard to get product on the pad and the pad gets oily fast and you have to wash it I don't know it's just a strange concept the whole container the way it opens the tiny amount of powder... More gimmicky than anything else.
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Sep-25,Bought this powder on Amazon Prime Day on discount just to try it. It works so much better than my expensive powders. It¡¯s my new favorite make up item. Definitely a great find!
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Sep-25,I¡¯m not sure if this was used but it¡¯s disgusting
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,23-Dec-25,"Hidrata muy bien la piel, la deja suave, funciona muy bien con pieles sensibles."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,22-Dec-25,This is the only thing that keeps my son¡¯s acne away. The scent is light and the package is easy to carry.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,19-Dec-25,I could see changes in my skin right away. I have sensitive skin so I was a little hesitant with the acid but no problems at all.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,15-Dec-25,Deja la cara tersa
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,01-Dec-25,"I have the 1.6fl oz size for over a year and still not done with it. I have combo skin erring on the more dry side usually.

My routine:
After showering, I do not dry my face and immediately use 2 quick tiny dabs of the gel on my entire face and neck. It is enough to leave me moisturized over night and into the middle of the day. I know this because my lips are notoriously dry and nothing has ever worked as consistently as this gel.

Pretty much a miracle worker for me."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,22-Nov-25,"Love the feel putting it on, great moisture."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,20-Nov-25,Best moisturizer. Light and leaves skin soft. Noticed improvement after a few days of use. A little goes a long way.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,19-Nov-25,I LOVE this moisturizer. I use the whole Water Bank collection and I love using this if my skin feels heavy or oily. Highly recommend.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,13-Nov-25,Feels so good on your skin. Great value for price
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,18-Oct-25,Save your money and buy the higher quality Neutrogena Hydro line instead. Only the sleeping mask is worth buying from the water bank line. I bought the entire water bank line and gave everything but the sleeping mask away.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,07-Oct-25,This is a great moisturizer for anyone looking for something that isn¡¯t too thick. It¡¯s light and still moisturizing. The scent is fresh and not overpowering. The ingredients aren¡¯t harmful or toxic to your body which is a HUGE plus! It goes on so smoothly and easily absorbed by your skin. I love this brand and love this as a daytime moisturizer. Just fantastic!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,10-Sep-25,"I bought this on sale¡¦and was more than pleasantly surprised. I was seeking an alternative to Lanc?me zen gel and found that my skin loves this so much more! It is light and refreshing with no overpowering scents. It does leave a slight glisten (which my tween tells me is all the rage).

Really like refillable option, environmentally savvy and helps keep the cost down.

*bonus¡¦it¡¯s just so satisfying to look at!"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,22-Aug-25,"very hydrated, great quality for me, good absorbing into the skin and great scent."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,29-Jun-25,"This face moisturizer is clear and keeps my skin hydrated for hours. I apply it at night, and by morning my face feels smooth, soft, and spongy. It¡¯s light, non-greasy, and works really well for overnight care. Perfect for a simple and effective skincare routine."

Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,14-Apr-25,Amoooo!!!! Es s?per ligera y sin ingredientes toxicos
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,28-Mar-25,The water gel is lightweight and doesn¡¯t aggravate my cystic acne. The scent is faint and not overwhelming. It definitely leaves my skin feeling moisturized. And I LOVE that you can buy a refill instead of a whole other component

Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,01-Mar-25,"Moisturizes the skin very well, I'm delighted"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,04-Feb-25,"I bought this because of the good reviews. I have oily/combination skin and this product is supposed to be made for that, but it makes my face feel oily and super greasy. Feels sticky & doesn¡¯t absorb well. It¡¯s doing the opposite of what I bought it for. Very disappointing. I will go back to my Neutrogena water gel for half the price."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,04-Feb-25,Texture is amazing. A little goes along way. Great under makeup
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,11-Dec-24,Gold star for my dry skin

Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,14-Aug-24,My friend got me a small container of this moisturizer as a gift and I liked it so much that I bought it again. I live in a humid climate and having a light fresh moisturizer feels good on my skin.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,19-Jul-24,I have oily skinn and I use this usually in the morning and at bedtime when I do my face routine but I love it.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,23-May-24,"I am prone to breakouts so this being a gel rather than a cream was appealing to me. It works well, but I do wish it was a little less costly."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,22-Apr-24,Su textura deliciosa te deja la piel luminosa
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,09-Apr-24,The moisturizer I received smells rancid and is hard to use because of this.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,07-Apr-24,working good
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,18-Mar-24,I have been a HUGE fan of the Laneige gel moisturizer for quite some time and was super excited with the updated packaging that allows for refilling to cut down on waste. The refill is well sealed and packaged and easy to pop into your container. The moisturizer itself is the same amazing quality that has done wonders for my skin. The gel formula feels so light but keeps my dry eczema prone skin happily moisturized and wears great under makeup.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,18-Mar-24,I love everything about this moisturizer. I use it under makeup. This first then sunscreen I let it dry while straightening my hair. Love the faint scent the feeling on my skin is like a mini facial everyday.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,24-Feb-24,Worth trying
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,05-Feb-24,This moisturizer works so well and is super light weight. It is going to last me a long time because you don't need to use that much and its super spreadable. My skin barrier is feeling so healthy and glowy. Packaging is very satisfying as well and it even comes with a little applicator stick.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,01-Feb-24,"Since Amazon is selling the refill, wait until they sell the refillable version. The blue version currently listed is not refillable. If you check Sephora, or the Laniege site, you will see that the refillable container is a very light blue/ white. Then you can purchase the refill for less money and use less plastic. Save $$..save the planet! Win, win. Great product!!! Once you try, you will want refills. Perfect for oily skin."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,16-Jan-24,This product is fantastic! I use this after micro-needling. Your skin feels soft and definitely hydrated. A tiny bit goes a long way too. Love it!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,28-Nov-23,This product is lightweight and has a very subtle pleasant smell. It¡¯s makes your skin feel silky smooth and works on those fine lines and wrinkles. This is my go to moisturizer!!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,28-Nov-23,"The gel is lightweight but still moisturizing. I used to have flaky skin after putting on makeup, but after prepping with this, it smooth!"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,20-Nov-23,"Just ok, i wouldn't waste my money on this again."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,15-Nov-23,Lov how it hydrated your face!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,11-Nov-23,This is an amazing moisturizer. I have never written a review on Amazon in all of these years but this product is worth it! My skin has been so dry for months and this product hydrates my skin perfectly! No smell and long lasting hydration. Will definitely purchase again.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,23-Oct-23,Thought this would be my holy grail. But it broke me out
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,21-Oct-23,"I've only used this for a few days, but I can tell that this may be one of my staple products. It's so light and effective at the same time. My face feels so quenched and smooth, gives me a glow. The only con for me is that it's Kind of on the expensive side."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,30-Sep-23,I absolutely love how soft this has made my skin feel. I can go most days without any other product on my skin just due to the confidence I've gotten with this product. 10/10 will buy again!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,18-Sep-23,Was able to grab this during prime day. Love it so far! Makes my face feel so refreshed. Would definitely recommend!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,24-Aug-23,After using it and I feel comfortable on my skin .Smooth and moisturizing.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,19-Aug-23,use it when needed
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,14-Aug-23,"It is a very lightweight moisturizer with a pleasant barely noticeable scent. It goes on smoothly without leaving a sticky residue like other gel creams and also absorbs quickly. I find myself reaching for it every time I'm doing my daily facial routine, however, it is not a replacement for deep moisturizers.
I like all the LANEIGE products I previously used and this one did not disappoint."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,02-Aug-23,light and moisturizing
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,30-May-23,Gel like with beads. Feels nice and goes on smooth.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,11-May-23,This feels so good on your skin. My sister in-law greeted me with ¡®nice new lotion!¡¯. I never told her! She just knew looking at my face. Throughout the day if I touch my face it feels soft and hydrated. I will continue to use this product forever!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,19-Apr-23,Great selection to use especially during summer time. I feel the cooling and soothing sensation right away upon applying. Light weighted. No oily feeling and no stickiness. LANEIGE is the most reliable well-known brand in Korea under Amore Pacific group. So I already had high expectation and this gel cream is beyond my expectations!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,12-Apr-23,Absolutely love it so much!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,03-Apr-23,"This moisturizer is a gel type. It has little beads included in it that blend away when applying it to your face. There¡¯s a slight scent, but nothing overpowering. It does help my skin feel moisturized. The packaging is such overkill. A hunk of plastic. It could do with a much smaller packaging as it looks like you¡¯re getting a lot, but really the package is just chunky and makes it seem like you¡¯re getting more than you really are."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,04-Mar-23,"Est? roto y vencido. Ya al abrirlo vi que el color de la botella no era como la que me compr? antes, ademas estaba quebrado y la crema adentro no era crema si no un gel cuajado."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,20-Jan-23,This product is really excellent. It¡¯s a lightweight gel formula that absorbs so quickly. It isn¡¯t sticky or oily and it smells GREAT. It¡¯s not cheap but is a great value.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,26-Dec-22,"Light weight and great for my oily and sensitive skin. Also, a little goes a long way."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,21-Dec-22,I've been using Laneige for years now and it has never let me down. It's leaves my skin feeling revitalized and refreshed. It never causes any skin irritation as well. By far my favorite product in my skin care routine and I use it daily.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,20-Dec-22,ordered thinking its a better upgrade but wish laneige kept the older version. This is too pricey and quality is not the same as before.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,13-Nov-22,"I was hesitant to use this - it's hard to go from using a product you really like to upgrading to something that's twice the money. But my normal face cream has been out of stock, and I took the risk to try this. I will never go back! My skin has honestly never looked better. So happy with this product."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,05-Nov-22,"With so many great reviews I invested the money in this product. Felt cool going on, but didn¡¯t moisturize my skin any better than my drug store cream. As a matter of fact my skin felt rather dry the next morning."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,11-Sep-22,"I had purchased this product before and it was amazing. I change products based on seasons because my skin changes as the weather does. When I went to buy it again the look of packaging had changed. I didn¡¯t think anything of it until I got the product. It¡¯s very different than what I had gotten before and didn¡¯t work for my skin like it used to. I checked Laneige¡¯s website and these are the same products. Good brand, just doesn¡¯t work for my skin anymore."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,27-Aug-22,"I love Laniege products so much so I jumped on this right away. As usual, nice packaging but the product needs some fine tuning as it did not live up to expectations. Bummer (and it¡¯s too expensive)."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,25-Aug-22,"This is the perfect summer moisturizer, especially if you have oily skin. The hyaluronic acid keeps your skin hydrated, but not greasy. The moisturizer glides on and absorbs beautifully."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,23-Aug-22,I was really impressed with this product. I use it after sauna sessions at my gym when my face is extremely dry due to the lack of moisture. It works perfectly and seems to rejuvenate my skin. I was really impressed with this product and would recommend this to anyone who needs a good moisturizer.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,06-Aug-22,"I can't really fault the product because it's advertised as being for combo/oily skin, and you truly need to stick to that. With the summer heat I've been getting a little more blemishes and acne on my face (even though overall my skin is dry) so I figured changing up my moisturizer to something not so heavy would help. I think my skin is just to dry for this lightweight moisturizer to be able to work effectively, my skin still feels pretty dry after using.
I do love how lightweight it is however, it goes on your skin smooth and absorbs very quickly. I have sensitive skin as well and have had no irritation using it. The price is good and I'd recommend it for someone who just needs a little boost for moisturizing, and not for anyone with combo/ dry skin."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,31-Jul-22,"Laneige is one of the best known Korean skincare brands and their Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer is particularly good. It hydrates well without feeling heavy or greasy, leaving the skin feeling light but well nourished."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,29-Jul-22,If you have dehydrated oily skin - this product is your choice
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,15-Jul-22,Best face cream ever
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,13-Jul-22,"The Laneige Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer comes in a bulky little pretty plastic blue block with 1.6oz of medium-weight clear speckled gel moisturizer. Would have preferred a tube or something generating less waste. Retails for $40 as of this review, which is on-brand for Laneige, but still a hint expensive given the amount of product you are getting if you ask me. Still, it is a nice, mild hydrating gel. Non-irritating. Excellent spreadability with invisible coverage. Leaves me feeling a little sticky but I'm not shiny or greasy. Has a fresh scent to it; not overpowering, and doesn't linger. Doesn't trigger any respiratory allergy response, flares, or breakouts."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,07-Jul-22,"Favorite moisturizer and I love the new formula! The texture is great and non greasy, it¡¯s perfect for under makeup. Buy this!"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,06-Jul-22,"I prefer gel moisturizers and this one is great. It's really light and perfect for summer. I have normal skin so I may use something heavier come winter but for the warm weather it's great. Also the container is beautiful, I'm a sucker for simple and attractive containers."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,01-Jul-22,It is a cute container concept but I can never close it properly because every time I try to open it after closing the lid fully the gel bursts out which ends up being a waste of product and money
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,30-Jun-22,"This moisturizer is interesting. It¡¯s a clear gel moisturizer that has melting beads suspended in it. Laneige truly is a super trustworthy name in moisture. I got a tan recently and it really sucked the moisture out of the surface of my skin. This moisturizer was soothing and helped with the surface lines that come with a fresh tan. The beads melt quickly when rubbed between your hands and the gel moisturizer melts into skin and plumps. There¡¯s no harsh fragrance. My sense of smell is pretty shot right now because I¡¯ve been sick recently but I don¡¯t smell anything coming from this gel cream. I would absolutely recommend for day or night.
I hope this info was useful."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,26-Jun-22,"I thought this might make a good moisturizer for summer, something light yet capable of holding in some moisture on hot day. This is NOT that. This left me greasy/shiny in a bad way every time I used it. It made my skin feel gross, and even hours later it felt like it wasn't exactly sinking in. I discontinued using it for fear it might break me out."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,22-Jun-22,Face feels happy and looks more glowing after using this for a while! Scent is nice and mild. It¡¯s lightweight and dries quickly. Haven¡¯t had a breakout yet ????
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,22-Jun-22,"The moisturizer feels very refreshing and it¡¯s lightweight. It feels slightly sticky after applying, but it dries fine. As someone who has sensitive skin, I didn¡¯t experience any issues with this product. The moisturizer is a little watery, so be careful when pealing the protective seal."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,21-Jun-22,"Literally one of my favorite Korean brands. All their products are nice and affordable. I love how this leaves my skin, hydrated and refreshed."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,19-Jun-22,"Ok, so reading all the hype, Blue Hyaluronic Acid, is supposedly more effective than regular Hyaluronic Acid, mainly because it¡¯s molecules are 2000 times smaller than regular Hyaluronic Acid. And we want Hyaluronic Acid, because it is a humectant, that attracts up to 1000 times it¡¯s own weight in water. A smaller molecule is more easily absorbed into the skin, apparently, however, the tests for this claim were done on artificial skin, so i am skeptical until i hear from some real women. Not that i don¡¯t believe Hyaluronic Acid to be an effective ingredient, i just don¡¯t know that Blue Hyaluronic Acid is even better.
It is an effective anti-aging ingredient, and is naturally present in our body, we have more of it when we¡¯re young, and it depletes as we age. But it¡¯s used in skincare because of it¡¯s ability bind to, and to attract moisture into the skin cells. Plumping the skin cells, diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles apparently.

Anyway, you get a cute blue container with a spatula, in a blue box. Very classy looking. It contains a gel moisturizer, which is quite light, non-greasy, and does feel really cooling when you apply it. I like how it immediately feels on my skin. I can¡¯t say I¡¯ve noticed much reduction in the depth of the deep smoker¡¯s wrinkles I have around my mouth, however, i do think my crow¡¯s feet look less pronounced. Though I¡¯ve only been using this for a few days, and have not therefore given it a long enough time, i also don¡¯t believe that creams and potions can knock 20 years off the age of my skin, but I¡¯m willing to give it a fair go. I¡¯ve not suffered a reaction, any irritation or redness at all.
I think this is very fairly priced, as i consider this to be a desirable brand of skincare, whereas some designer labels add $150 onto the price of their moisturizer just because they¡¯re a designer. I don¡¯t think those would perform any better than this one does.
I¡¯ll be back to edit, if i notice more reduction of deeper wrinkles, but so far, i am enjoying how hydrated my skin feels."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,16-Jun-22,"Easy to use lightweight gel moisturizer. Great watery fresh scent that isn't too strong.
A little goes a long way.
You can use it alone as a light summer moisturizer, or if your skin is dry you could use it as a serum layered with heavier cream. It mixes easily with facial oils too.
The packaging is stylish but not that convenient. The square lid is hard to unscrew. It comes with a little paddle so you don't have to stick your fingers in the jar, however there's no built-in place to store the little paddle."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,16-Jun-22,I have been using it since 6/5/2022 and my skin has felt better than ever. Its smooth and well hydrated. I will definitely add to my list for purchasing again.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,15-Jun-22,"I love the feel of this on my face, but it isn't quite hydrating enough for my slightly dry skin."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,14-Jun-22,This moisturizer has been helping my skin and my mom's become plumper! My mom especially loves how it is helping her aging skin and keeping it moisturized. I catch her leaving this in her room now!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,12-Jun-22,"This moisturizer is wonderful for dry skin. It applies easily and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth, without any irritation."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,10-Jun-22,"The first thing I noticed was that I could not read the printing on the jar. It is a light blue in color and the printing is white. Even if the printing was black, the font size was so small that I had to keep the box in order to understand how it was recommended to use the gel. It comes with a small flat paddle so you don't get the gel under your nails when getting it out of the jar. Next, I found beads in the gel. I haven't a clue what they were supposed to be about. It only takes a small amount to get enough to cover face/neck. I didn't notice a scent and it didn't absorb into amy face as I had hoped. Not my favorite product."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,09-Jun-22,I'm absolutely loving the consistency of this gel moisturizer. Its light and perfect for these hot summer days. I have sensitive skin and is gentle yet effective!
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,08-Jun-22,"I'm in love with this line of products by Laneige. They are a little pricey but a little goes a long way. I personally paired the eye cream with the gel and wow! Initially I wanted a cream for my face but someone recommend ed I try this so I rolled the dice on it. Omg for a gel this stuff is amazing totally changed my outlook on gels. It smells great, works great and pairs excellent with the eye cream -FANTASTIC combo and plumps great under makeup for a flawless look. It comes with a application stick too which is nice so your not always having to finger apply. I'm very happy and the combo is a great replacement match to pricer brands."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,08-Jun-22,"This refreshing cool gel really helped my dry, parched skin! It absorbs well into the skin, without making it oily, and leaves the skin feeling smoother and more plump the next day. I also felt the wrinkles on my forehead were less noticeable after a few days of use.

A small amount goes a long way. Using the gel moisturizer at night worked best for me. I tried using it in the daytime under makeup, and it felt too sticky for that purpose.

It is mildly scented and not overpowering. The cute blue container is sealed and came with a spatula for application. I have been using it mainly at night and it leaves my skin feeling soft and well hydrated and not at all oily. Hyaluronic acid is great for hydration of the skin.

I have sensitive skin and so I tend to break out, but I did not notice any problems after using this hyaluronic acid gel moisturizer. I've tried other products in the past from Laneige and have been pleased with all of them."
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,07-Jun-22,"Lightweight but very hydrating without being heavy or oily. Excellent for combination skin and does not irritate my sensitive skin. This gel goes on smooth and you need to give it a minute or so to soak in otherwise it feels slight like a wet tacky film but again that goes away and doesn't leave behind anything. Since my skin is slightly dry I do apply Kiehl's Cannabis Sativa Seed Oil Herbal Concentrate Face Oil as my base.

Skin Type - I am 36 with and my skin type is - Dry, slightly combination and it tends to be sensitive on my cheeks where I have seasonal rosacea. I have some fine wrinkles around my eyes and a few broken capillaries on my cheeks. Overall my skin feels a bit rough if I do not follow my skin care routine and keep my skin properly moisturized.

Price - Fair and on par with similar brands
Quality - High
Worth the hype? Yes"
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,07-Jun-22,I'm a sucker for a good gel moisturizer and this one is awesome. It's very lightweight and feels so refreshing on your skin. It absorbs easily and I love the cute blue container.
Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Gel Moisturizer,04-Jun-22,"There is nothing special at all with this moisturizer. Upon opening the protective seal, half of the moisturizer spilled. It is very liquidy/runny. It comes with a small stick to scoop out the moisturizer so you don't use your hands. I used a decent amount of my face, it spreads very easily. It dries very quickly but its just not moisturizing at all. I have acne prone, combination skin (mostly oily) and this didn't work. This may work on super hot day for oily skin but I don't really think this is ideal for dry skin. This is so light that it can be used as a serum/emulsion before a moisturizer. This product is way too pricy. for $40, you can get something much, much better."
Water Sleeping Mask,24-Dec-25,I love this stuff. I use it on my hands. It keeps the skin on my hands from cracking and chapping during the winter months.
Water Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,"Got this as a gift to myself, loveeee them. My skin is so soft from using these"

Water Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Muy buenk
Water Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This sleeping mask has been key to getting through cold weather and the dryness caused by forced-air heating. My skin feels and looks noticeably more hydrated and comfortable in the morning. It absorbs well overnight, smells great and has become part of my regular winter routine."
Water Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,My favorite skincare line. Highly recommend!
Water Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,Super hydrating and very effective for dry skin. The formula can feel sticky while drying down but thick enough to provide all day/night moisture.
Water Sleeping Mask,12-Dec-25,This would be great for someone living in a very humid climate as this is literally like water with zero hydration.
Water Sleeping Mask,10-Dec-25,Feels great on skin ! Love these so much and a great gift

Water Sleeping Mask,09-Dec-25,"This is my got to sleeping mask that gives me glowy hydrating skin. I love to use it at night after face mask. It absorbs quick, lightweight and not sticky. It smells nice and my skin always feel soft, hydrate and smooth the next day."
Water Sleeping Mask,09-Dec-25,"GET IT. the products are high-quality¡¦ I can tell there¡¯s hydration happening in my skin, especially when I wear a sleeping tape over the areas at night¡¦ You¡¯re just buying the large blue sleeping mask, which is probably why you¡¯re looking at this mask, but the additional two testers were really sweet and the bag that it comes in is my favorite thing ever¡¦ I use the bag for lip gloss now!!!"
Water Sleeping Mask,09-Dec-25,These hydrating masks make my skin baby soft! I love that it comes with two travel size masks too.
Water Sleeping Mask,09-Dec-25,Love this product - very hydrating
Water Sleeping Mask,08-Dec-25,"This mask makes my skin feel so nice and smooth. I love how easy it is to use. I think it¡¯s a great size, you don¡¯t need to use slot. It smells great and feels moisturizing. Recommend!!!!"
Water Sleeping Mask,08-Dec-25,"What is this sorcery???? It's fantastic! I wake up with soft and plump skin.

I don't use any other products at night. I just wash my face, tone and then use this sleeping mask... and my skin just drinks this product up! If you're thinking about purchasing, just do it!"
Water Sleeping Mask,06-Dec-25,Wonderful consistency!
Water Sleeping Mask,05-Dec-25,Love this product my skin feels so smooth and glows after using it!
Water Sleeping Mask,04-Dec-25,"This stuff makes me wake up looking like I actually slept eight hours and drank water, even though we all know I did neither. It¡¯s like cheating at skincare. My face feels soft, calm, and weirdly plump in the morning. Ten out of ten for tricking people into thinking I have my life together"
Water Sleeping Mask,03-Dec-25,"This is my third time buying this mask and ever since I introduced it to my best friend, she has also bought it multiple times too. This mask truly makes your skin so hydrated and you wake up so shiny, glowy and with skin that is truly illuminating. I struggle relentlessly with dry skin and this has been great for me. It never causes me to breakout and it doesn't stain your pillow or clothes, so that is also a win! I promise you won't regret it, and if you wait till amazon prime day or Black Friday, the deal is great also! Highly recommend."
Water Sleeping Mask,03-Dec-25,This is my fourth jar. Feels very plump and hydrating. My skin feels soft the next day.
Water Sleeping Mask,02-Dec-25,"My daughter (12YO) and I (40YO) absolutely adore this as a night cream and/or mask. Great for while I'm traveling as well. Super hydrating. Light smell, very clean. Not too thick. Great for all types of skin."
Water Sleeping Mask,02-Dec-25,"Holy grail product for me! Amazing daily moisturizer, not too heavy or too light and smells lovely"
Water Sleeping Mask,01-Dec-25,"Super suave, tiene una textura muy ligera, es la segunda vez que la compro."
Water Sleeping Mask,30-Nov-25,"I bought this to use before bed. It is great, not sticky at all so you can put on and go straight to bed. My skin is so soft in the morning and well hydrated. I have sensitivities to strong smells, but the smell is gentle and doesn't bother me at night"
Water Sleeping Mask,25-Nov-25,"This is my absolute favorite overnight mask!
I¡¯ve been using it every night before bed for almost two years, and I¡¯m truly impressed with the results.
My skin looks fresh, glowing, healthy, and well-nourished in the morning ?
I¡¯m very happy with it ? it really works!"
Water Sleeping Mask,25-Nov-25,"I absolutely love this. In the summertime, I use it at night and it gives my skin the perfect amount of lightweight hydration. In the winter, I actually use it as my day moisturizer, and it works beautifully. It keeps my skin soft, smooth. My skin truly loves this product!"
Water Sleeping Mask,22-Nov-25,Great for my daughter
Water Sleeping Mask,21-Nov-25,Great!
Water Sleeping Mask,20-Nov-25,"The product really works best for me personally. It keeps my face hydrated and refreshing. It¡¯s a light weight mask, not sticky
I use it every single night and is really the best. Worth the price
I strongly recommend LANEIGE WATER SLEEPING MASK. You must try it."
Water Sleeping Mask,18-Nov-25,Very moisturizing. Great product
Water Sleeping Mask,16-Nov-25,"This is currently $30 for 2.36oz, which is pretty good both on price and size, so that makes me feel like I can use this nightly. Which is great, because it seems to work so well!

Sidenote, since appearance of the product is important too, the glass jar with a kind of color fade to clear looks nice. I like it.

But yes, this moisturizer goes on cleanly and absorbs well. I don't feel greasy despite its effectiveness. I'm not terribly sure of the proper order of things, but I use this after a good cleanse and serum and it prevents my face from drying out while also not breaking out at all. I've worked this into my nightly rotations for awhile and I just love it. My face feels soft without breaking the bank."
Water Sleeping Mask,16-Nov-25,Leaves my skin silky smooth.
Water Sleeping Mask,14-Nov-25,This didn¡¯t do anything and for how expensive it was I¡¯m pretty disappointed.
Water Sleeping Mask,14-Nov-25,"Best face product I have ever bought so far! I bought the face wash also and plan on buying more of this line of products. My face wash also dry and after one night of using this, my dry skin was hydrated and it looks great. It has made my skin so smooth that my makeup isn¡¯t cakey anymore. I highly recommend this line of products and I don¡¯t get paid to say it. I write reviews so others can benefit from great products on Amazon"
Water Sleeping Mask,13-Nov-25,"Love love love, I use this every night and sometimes for day time also."
Water Sleeping Mask,12-Nov-25,This water sleeping mask is so refreshing to my skin. I have combination/oily skin and this has only moisturized my skin without clogging my pores. I wake up with the smoothest skin I have ever had after using this. The quality is top notch! It is not sticky or goopy. It goes on smoothly and feels great. Highly recommend!
Water Sleeping Mask,10-Nov-25,"I love the water sleeping mask. It leaves your skins super fresh, hydrated, bright and soft. Haven¡¯t used much the other two masks included buy they have a really nice texture."
Water Sleeping Mask,09-Nov-25,"This stuff is amazing. There isn¡¯t a smell
And it Goes on very nicely. It¡¯s also quick drying and not sticky It makes your skin Pretty smooth and I¡¯m in my 50s!"
Water Sleeping Mask,04-Nov-25,"The LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask has a cool, lightweight gel texture that feels instantly soothing as it sinks in. I wake up to skin that looks refreshed, soft, and smooth without any greasy residue. The squalane, hyaluronic acid, and probiotic-derived ingredients really boost hydration and help keep my skin barrier calm and balanced.

It¡¯s perfect for normal or combination skin and gives that healthy, well-rested glow overnight. I think it¡¯s an excellent value for the results and quality. I truly love Laneige products.

Thank you for reading my review :)"
Water Sleeping Mask,04-Nov-25,"Very nice, slippery to apply, but dries nicely and can wear all night. My skin was better hydrated in the morning!"
Water Sleeping Mask,03-Nov-25,This product is great. I ¡°had¡± mustache lines that were deep & after using g this product & the daytime (light blue container) the lines are smooth & not as noticeable. You will love these
Water Sleeping Mask,02-Nov-25,"A lot of the comments make it see like this product is the greatest thing ever. I used it for a few days but did not notice any significant difference. My face did feel a little more moist in the mornings but nothing drastic. I will say, if you have sensitive skin then do not buy this product. After the first use it made my eyes swell up and become puffy in the morning. I tried again trying to avoid my eyes and just did my forehead, cheeks, and chin but still the same thing. I have since stopped using it and don't know what to do with the full jar I have left."
Water Sleeping Mask,26-Oct-25,Love this it brightens my skin making me look 10 and gets rid of wrinkles and lines.
Water Sleeping Mask,25-Oct-25,Love this product!
Water Sleeping Mask,24-Oct-25,Bien echo
Water Sleeping Mask,21-Oct-25,"I have dry sensitive skin and this has made a huge difference in the moisture and tone of my skin. Once it dries it¡¯s not sticky, which I like- I hate when my skincare feels like it gets on my pillows. There is a light fragrance but it disappears quickly. Will definitely keep buying!"
Water Sleeping Mask,20-Oct-25,"This is the original formula?the Laneige sleeping mask vs the water sleeping mask EX.
I usually use the EX version which does not break me out, but this version does!"
Water Sleeping Mask,15-Oct-25,"This is the BEST moisturizer I've ever used!! Been using for 2 weeks with Water Bank cleanser, visible improvement in my skin."
Water Sleeping Mask,14-Oct-25,"Put it on, slept in it, and it made my face more dry than when I put it on the day before? Woke up, washed it off and have literal dry patches around my nose and mouth. What a waste of a product when the point is to hydrate your skin"
Water Sleeping Mask,12-Oct-25,"The LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask is that girl in your nighttime skincare lineup ! The one that quietly fixes your skin while you¡¯re dreaming about quitting your 9-to-5. It¡¯s a lightweight gel mask packed with squalane and probiotic-derived ingredients that leave your skin plump, hydrated, and straight-up radiant by morning!

The scent is light and spa-like, just enough to make your nighttime routine feel like self-care, not a chore. It doesn¡¯t clog pores or leave residue on your pillow. Just soft, glowy, baby-smooth skin that looks like a filter IRL."
Water Sleeping Mask,04-Oct-25,"This has become one of my favorite sleeping masks. The light blue mask feels substantial but not heavy at all. The jar is a large and a little goes a long way. I find it works great for overnight moisturizing, rehydrating my dry/combination skin while I sleep. I have had no issues with stickiness. I¡¯ve found myself reaching for this many times, and will likely continue to buy it in the future."
Water Sleeping Mask,26-Sep-25,"I love these overnight masks. First, they keep my treatment serums from rubbing off at night, this covers and absorbs slowly. I can just splash water on my face in the morning and not need a lot of moisturizer. Second, if I do a peel or scrub, this is very cooling and healing overnight. It does not clog pores or cause breakouts. It is soothing and cool. You do need to use a lot so this big jar will last a while."
Water Sleeping Mask,26-Sep-25,"Ummmm are you joking? This paired with a cica toner is absolute chef¡¯s kiss. I honestly didn¡¯t expect to like it as much as I do. I normally don¡¯t use sleeping masks but this really just feels like a moisturizer to me so that¡¯s exactly how I use it. It feels so nice on my skin, absorbs quickly without leaving a heavy layer, and leaves my face soft, supple, and hydrated not even by morning BEFORE morning like 20 mins after applying lol. At first I was going in thinking it was probably just a bit hyped up and overpriced but I was pleasantly proven wrong lol!

I¡¯ve only used Laneige lip products before, so this was such a great intro to their skincare line. The texture¡¯s lightweight not sticky at all and it layers well with other products without pilling. My skin drinks it up and looks plump and refreshed the next day. For the price I think its a great quality sleepig mask/moisturizer and definitely something I¡¯ll keep in my routine."
Water Sleeping Mask,26-Sep-25,I liked that jar is sealed but it was so strong and case is already broken. It still works though. This applies like normal aqua gel. It is little sticky when dried but doesn't bother me during night time. I feel my skin is moisturized next day and l liked that it is not oily. It does not give dramatic results but seems to be good enough.
Water Sleeping Mask,24-Sep-25,"I bought this on a whim, and I LOVE it! It calls irritated skin, and I just love it. It feels nice going on, and it works so well."
Water Sleeping Mask,21-Sep-25,"I'm not sure what I was expecting with this. It is a little slippery and watery, doesn't really sink into the skin and sort of sits on top of it. It got all over my pillow. I guess it hydrated? Not any more than my other usual go to. My skin didn't appear any more dewy of glowy than normal. It is a good size and quantity though and maybe I will keep using it (I have used it for 2 weeks) to see if I am impressed later. So far seems mediocre for the price."
Water Sleeping Mask,21-Sep-25,"I used the Laneige Water Sleeping mask years ago and adored it. It was like a hydration bomb but not so heavy as to clog pores. I jumped at the opportunity to try this new version of the mask, and after a few weeks of testing¡¦I¡¯m disappointed. The new formula just doesn¡¯t hydrate as well. If I apply the mask right after cleansing, it never fully absorbs and leaves my skin feeling tight. My face is an oil slick by morning. I even tried layering it with other moisturizing products I know my skin likes, but something in the new mask formula still triggers oil overproduction (maybe the niamicinide?). It¡¯s a bummer, because I usually love Laneige products. The texture of the mask still feels really nice, but it lacks the moisturizing qualities of the old formula. The fragrance is also super strong (something I don¡¯t remember being an issue with past renditions). I think Laneige might need to go back to the drawing board with this one."
Water Sleeping Mask,20-Sep-25,"I've been a longtime fan of the Laneige lip sleeping mask. It's the only thing keeps my lips moist overnight. This mask has the same effect, but for your entire face. It's a lightweight, super hydrating moisturizer that really penetrates the skin and allows you to wake up with a bit of a natural glow. It contains niacinamide, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid, all great for your skin. It feels refreshing and cool as it goes on. You may experience a slight bit of tackiness in your skin as it's being absorbed, but it's not sticky. I do notice a definite improvement in how my skin feels in the morning when I use it versus when I don't. I've only found one other product that works as well as this one and for the same size jar, it's twice the price. This may look expensive initially, but given the benefits as compared to other higher-end skin care brands, it's really a deal! I plan to keep using this several times per week, especially headed into the fall and winter months when skin is more naturally dry."
Water Sleeping Mask,20-Sep-25,Love this face mask! It is extremely hydrating but doesn¡¯t leave skin feeling greasy or weighed down. It¡¯s not sticky and doesn¡¯t leave any kind of residue on my pillow. The jar is fairly large and a little goes a long way so I think it will last quite a while.
Water Sleeping Mask,17-Sep-25,I had a girlfriend buy me this for Christmas and it¡¯s amazing! I plan on keeping it in my skin care routine.
Water Sleeping Mask,15-Sep-25,Girlfriend really appreciated this and commented that right away it made her skin feel smoother and more hydrated. I would recommend this if you¡¯re looking for a good quality skin care product.
Water Sleeping Mask,14-Sep-25,"Absolutely amazing. It¡¯s not like a real mask you put on and have to peel off. It¡¯s so smooth and moisturizing. It¡¯s a clear smooth cream. You rub on before bed. Just wash face in the morning before normal skincare. It leaves face so soft & hydrated. It¡¯s a good size and my daughter said it¡¯s the type you can get refills for. Have tried taken inner piece out, but it looks like it can be taken out."
Water Sleeping Mask,12-Sep-25,"This light blue mask has a gel-like texture that feels pretty weightless and light on the skin. It glides on so easily and really sinks in. The color is clear during and after application. Before using this mask, I wash my face and apply a hydrating toner and serums, followed by this mask. The directions on the website are more thorough compared to the box, but I chose to use a hydrating toner and serums first. The directions from the website: ¡°After face cream, apply evenly across face. Leave treatment on overnight and rinse off in the morning.¡± I hope that helps.

As for my results, I haven¡¯t been all that impressed. My skin doesn¡¯t feel more hydrated, fresh, moisturized, or any other impressive adjective. It looks and feels the same as if I¡¯d done my normal routine. That said, of course your results might be different. Perhaps my normal routine is comparable to this product. It¡¯s not a bad product, it just didn¡¯t produce the results I was expecting. Based on the other reviews, it appears that people love this mask, and that I¡¯m not the norm!

You don't need to use a lot of product, and at 2.36 oz., it's a decent size which makes it a good value, especially if you have results like the majority of users."
Water Sleeping Mask,12-Sep-25,"I already love the Laneige products I have, so I trusted this cream for my skin. Have to say, I didn't know what a 'sleeping mask' entailed in a cosmetic product, but I do have night creams I love, and figured this would be a version of that. Not only am I getting older, but I live in a very dry area, so moisturizing is my main concern. I have no illusions that anything is going to get rid of wrinkles, but at least my skin can be soft. This does that, very effectively, at a reasonable price point (compared to some of the products out there). The consistency is kind of jelly-like vs. cream, which was a bit odd for me at first, but now I like it. I put it on very sparingly at first, not knowing how well it would absorb, and realized I could be more generous with it. It's a tiny bit sticky/tacky just after application, but soon melts in, and by morning my face feels wonderfully moisturized. No problems with transferring anything to my pillow. I think this is a great product for all age groups: if you're younger and don't yet feel like a raisin, you could put on a little less and still have nicely moisturized skin. Has a light, pleasant fragrance; not too strong."
Water Sleeping Mask,12-Sep-25,"The Laneige water sleeping mask was a nice addition to our nightly skin routine. Quality ingredients, quality product. Product has minimal scent. Great addition to layering as a final step to my nightly skin care routine. Acts as a barrier to hold moisture in at night and waking up with skin feeling refreshed. Would recommend."
Water Sleeping Mask,11-Sep-25,"I¡¯ve been using this mask a few nights a week and honestly it¡¯s like giving my skin a tall glass of water while I sleep. It feels light and cooling when applied and by morning, my skin looks more refreshed and plump. I noticed a soft glow and less dryness, especially around my cheeks. It doesn¡¯t clog pores or feel sticky which I was a bit worried about at first. The texture is silky and smooth and a little goes a long way! Great for when your skin needs a reset overnight. Definitely a staple in my night routine now. Great brand and great product for a good price."
Water Sleeping Mask,11-Sep-25,"This is a lovely, effective face cream. It seems like overnight creams are often really thick and greasy, but this one is light and while it moisturizes, it doesn't feel like it sits on your skin. The scent is fresh and clean, like the smell that hits you when you walk into a spa. It left my skin smooth and soft without any oily residue. Love it."
Water Sleeping Mask,10-Sep-25,"MY ??RATINGS:
5??- EXCEEDS MY EXPECTATIONS! TOP QUALITY & MUST HAVE.
20250910

This is my go-to mask during the cold, dry winter months. It deeply hydrates my skin while eliminating the dullness that winter brings. Applying it three times a week makes my skin brighter and healthier. I use it as the final step in my facial regimen. After applying my moisturizer, I apply the mask and leave it on all night, washing it off in the morning.

EXPIRATION DATE: 12M After Opening
I always check the expiration date before using health and beauty products, especially.

This Sleep Mask is PRICED in the usual range."
Water Sleeping Mask,09-Sep-25,I love this brand and this product! It's amazing and it always gets the jon done. It's so amazing on my skin. Always a favorite! The size is worth it but it can cost a bit. Overall though its hydrating and very worth it. Not too sticky and good consistency.
Water Sleeping Mask,08-Sep-25,"LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask

I wanted to love this, but knew as soon as I opened it that I wouldn't be able to toleate the fragrance. I absolutely cannot sleep in anything with fragrance, so I tried it a few hours before bedtime, being careful to avoid my eye and nose area because I'm sensitive to fragrance in just about every way. I wanted to leave it on until just before I went to bed, but had to wash it off after just about an hour because it was too much for my sensitive sinuses to bear. It didn't irritate my skin in the short time I had it on, and I think I would love it if it were fragrance-free. I like the texture of the cream, the way it made my skin feel, and even the color. look, and feel of the jar. I'm so disappointed."
Water Sleeping Mask,07-Sep-25,"This Water Sleeping Mask in a blue jar is one of the most famous bestsellers from LANEIGE. I purchased this mask for the first time in 2012, as a travel miniature of 20 g. Since then, I purchased it several more time, again in travel size, as it was super convenient to take on travel and it worked magically after long flights. Today, when I still admire and use Korean skin care cosmetics every day, I prefer to check the ingredients first. I like that this mask contains squalane, niacinamide, ceramide NP, and several types of hyaluronic acid. However, the mask contains also a lot of silicones. I¡¯m trying to avoid silicones, but I know they can be effective in creating an occlusive effect, and this is what this mask is about.

This night sleeping mask is a sort of wrapping mask, intended to seal in all layers of previously applied products and it should be the very last product to be applied in the evening before bed. In the Korean multi-step routine, it means that you may already apply toner, serums, actives, essences, eye cream, moisturizer(s) and only THEN apply this sleeping mask to seal everything in. The opinions are divided between ¡°mask works great¡± and ¡°it did nothing and dried out my skin¡±. In the second case, most probably it was related with not applying enough layers of products before this mask, expecting it can work solo, or known issue with hyaluronic acid, which, instead of hydration, can draw moisture from the skin if you are in a dry environment. So, a lot of products should be applied quickly on super dump skin and then this moisture should be locked in with good moisturizer or this sleeping mask or both.

The mask has a lightweight, gel-like watery consistency of opaque, milky color, and it has a rather subtle smell (to my very sensitive nose, it is not intense at all). It spreads effortlessly on the skin, providing some cooling sensation just after application. I use it 2 days a week, I apply a very generous layer of the mask over several layers of other products in my night routine. It absorbs quick, it does not feel sticky or heavy despite layering it over other products. In the morning, it looks like the mask had been fully absorbed during the night, after washing it off, my face is very soft and feels moisturized (which I still believe mostly thanks to other products underneath the mask, while the mask role was mainly occlusive).

Therefore, I still like this mask and provided effects, and I will keep using it a few times per week, even though I dislike some ingredients."
Water Sleeping Mask,05-Sep-25,"Great value! $3 more than the water mask alone, and you get small sizes of the other 2, and a cute travel bag."
Water Sleeping Mask,05-Sep-25,"The LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask provides great hydration. It goes on like a night cream, is sticky/ tacky at first and once dried the tacky feeling goes away. You wash your face in the morning and you are left with hydrated and smooth skin.
Perhaps I missed it somewhere but I couldn't find anywhere on the box or jar if the product was non-comedogenic. Searching separately and was able to find that the product is in fact non-comedogenic."
Water Sleeping Mask,05-Sep-25,"This overnight mask sits like dew on leaves when applied. The instructions are very straightforward. Just apply. I used toner before I applied the clear mask. When I awoke, my face was normal. Not dry, but also not dewy.
I washed my face off with just water. At the very least, my skin is behaving properly. I guess it's something nice to use for a little extra care at night."
Water Sleeping Mask,05-Sep-25,"I love Laneige and have used their cream skin toner morning and night consistently for several years now. I was over the moon to try out this water sleeping mask because I have very dry skin and was looking for something exactly like this¡¦ An overnight product to plump and boost my skin more than a traditional moisturizer. I love everything about this sleeping mask, except for the fact that it contains added fragrance. I am very sensitive to added scents so if this existed in a fragrance free version, it would be my go to for life."
Water Sleeping Mask,04-Sep-25,"Love this sleeping mask so much! I've used their lotions before, and of course the best lip mask, but this mask is incredible as well. The container is amazing as well (I think it's a new style). It looks like the container is floating inside if you look at it from the side. After using it, my skin feels amazing, and really does look refreshed in the morning."
Water Sleeping Mask,23-Aug-25,it was really tiny.
Water Sleeping Mask,19-Aug-25,my gf always uses it
Water Sleeping Mask,17-Aug-25,20/10 last night was my first time using this and usually it take a week+ to see if I can tell a difference in products I use but this was over night results!!!!
Water Sleeping Mask,08-Aug-25,I gifted it for my boyfriend and he says that it's clogging his pores. He now has a big cystic pimple around his eyebrows and adds that it painful
Cica Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,"I¡¯ve been using this sleeping mask a few nights a week, and have found it to be perfect for dry winter conditions. The texture is thick and cushiony, but not goopy or sticky, so it spreads easily and stays breathable on the skin. It feels comforting going on, even though I don't have particularly sensitive skin. I wake up with skin that looks soothed and moisturized. While the instructions say to wipe off excess in the morning, I don't find that there is any. Which is a good thing, because I'd probably find it on my pillows if there was some left on the surface of my skin.

I very much appreciate that it is fragrance free, because while my skin isn't sensitive, my nose IS. I despise fragranced skin care products and the cheaper versions can even give me a headache, which of course this does not. I don't know what Centella complex is, but I do know that this product does a good job soothing without clogging pores, and my skin feels hydrated rather than coated in the morning.

I have used other Laneige products (lip sleeping mask and the water moisturizers) and this is a great addition to a skin care routine in dry conditions."
Cica Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"I¡¯ve really enjoyed other products I¡¯ve tried from this brand, and the LANEIGE Cica Sleeping Mask continues to impress as a deeply hydrating overnight treatment. According to the product description, this gentle Korean sleeping mask delivers soothing moisture while calming stressed skin and supporting barrier repair with a rich, fragrance-free balm-cream formula that wraps skin in breathable hydration. What stood out to me personally is the thicker, heavier consistency compared to lighter masks. It truly locks in moisture, making it especially great for dry winter months when extra hydration is needed. Overall, it¡¯s a lovely mask that feels effective and comforting on the skin."
Cica Sleeping Mask,07-Dec-25,"LANEIGE Cica Sleeping Mask is an exceptional product that does exactly what it claims. I originally used the blue jar, but heard the green jar is more suitable for dry skin while the blue one is better for oily skin.
After I received this product, I immediately try on it. After using this twice, I'm impressed. The texture is luxuriously thick and feels wonderfully cool and soothing on application. More importantly, the latest version is fragrance-free, which is a huge win for sensitive skin. On nights when my skin feels tight or looks red, I apply a thin layer after my moisturizer. By morning, my skin feels noticeably softer, plumper, and significantly calmer. As someone with dry skin, I noticed an immediate difference?my skin felt deeply hydrated, more supple, and any flakiness was gone. This sleeping mask is an absolute game-changer for lazy skincare routines; no more fussing with sheet masks!
At $35 for 60ml, it's worth every penny for resilient, calm skin. Highly recommend for anyone dealing with sensitivity or redness."
Cica Sleeping Mask,05-Dec-25,"As someone who's used a ton of Laneige products, I know that they make quality products.
I've used the water sleeping mask, the water gel moisturizer, water bank serum, the cleansing foam, the cream skin toner, the lip balm, and now I'm trying this product.
Directions are simple, apply one to two times a week at night as the final step of skincare routine, and then wash off in the morning.
Although the product is very thick, it does not feel thick on the skin, and it gets absorbed easily without feeling sticky or greasy at all. This is also fragrance free, which is great for people with sensitive skin. While this feels very moisturizing, it does not clog pores, which is excellent.
Unlike the other masks from Laneige, this does not brighten or plump up your skin, so if those are your needs, then you should look at the water sleeping mask or the bouncy and firm sleeping mask.
If you're looking for a quality sleeping mask and have sensitive skin, then definitely give this one a try."
Cica Sleeping Mask,04-Dec-25,"I have used this product for about five years and loved it before they changed the formula. I have sensitive skin and I live in the Rockies where it¡¯s dry all year, and this sleeping mask was indispensable in my routine.

This new formula though is not it. I found it to not moisturize as well and it irritated my skin. I saw the new packing when I went to reorder but I wouldn¡¯t have purchased if I knew the formula was also new. I¡¯m disappointed and will not be repurchasing."
Cica Sleeping Mask,04-Dec-25,"I love how this feels on my face! It is silky soft and smooth without any stickiness.

This moisturizing cream absorbs quickly into my skin. I live in a very dry climate and can feel the hydration.

Love this product!"
Cica Sleeping Mask,25-Nov-25,"So far I enjoy this product. It is very hydrating and seems to be a good overnight mask. Like others, I don't rinse it off in the morning but just follow my usual routine and my skin does seem to be getting softer. I also agree that the packaging is decietful, but otherwise, I like this product."
Cica Sleeping Mask,22-Nov-25,I love Laneige skin products they leave my face soft and hydrated. I¡¯ve tried all of the sleep mask versions and this one has been my favorite. My face doesn¡¯t feel sticky once it¡¯s dry.
Cica Sleeping Mask,18-Nov-25,"Laneige has become my go-to brand for skincare. Their lip sleeping masks are outstanding, and they really help to restore my severely chapped lips. This sleeping mask is another high quality product. It's rich and very thick without being greasy or sticky. In the winter, my face gets really chapped, but this mask has been awesome. It has no fragrance. Five stars."
Cica Sleeping Mask,17-Nov-25,"It's starting to get so much colder and dryer as we inch toward winter. This was the perfect fix for my skin. I was starting to get some flaking on my cheeks and under eyes, but this has turned that around in only a week. I love it so much! The container is so cute. There is definitely less in the container than you would think because of how the container is made (you can see in the photos). It is still wonderful and great for the winter."
Cica Sleeping Mask,17-Nov-25,"I absolutely love the LANEIGE Cica Sleeping Mask! As someone with sensitive skin, I¡¯ve struggled to find a product that soothes and hydrates without causing irritation. This mask is a game-changer. It provides deep hydration overnight, leaving my skin feeling soft, calm, and refreshed by morning. The formula is gentle yet incredibly effective, and I¡¯ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin¡¯s barrier repair. Highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin looking for a soothing and nourishing overnight treatment!"
Cica Sleeping Mask,16-Nov-25,Love this cream and product line. It¡¯s really thick but not greasy when you put it on. I haven¡¯t used for a very long time so I can¡¯t tell results but my feel hydrated. I really Laneige and have quite a few of their products. This cream is amazing!
Cica Sleeping Mask,13-Nov-25,"The texture is thick enough to feel substantial but doesn¡¯t sit heavy or greasy. It smooths on easily and settles into the skin without leaving a mess behind. No residue on the pillow, no sticky feeling in the morning. I've used it nightly since I received it and it's helped make things feel 'normal' again in the morning, surprisingly after days when my skin feels a little overworked or dry, and the swings in weather have hammered away at me. There¡¯s no scent, which is something I needed in order to even get to sleep.

So far, no irritation, no clogged pores, no weird reactions. Just a steady, calming effect that shows up the next day. The formula seems to do well with sensitive spots and has helped ease redness after long days outside or in dry air. It rinses off clean in the morning and leaves my skin feeling soft and 'back to normal'.

The packaging is simple and clean. The container hasn¡¯t leaked or cracked, and it¡¯s easy to scoop out just the right amount. It¡¯s traveled well and hasn¡¯t made a mess in a bag or drawer. The mask spreads evenly and doesn¡¯t take much to cover the face. The price is a bit much for my regular nightly routine, but I understand that in the segment of beauty/care, prices can get pretty high. It's a solid product if it fits your budget."
Cica Sleeping Mask,12-Nov-25,"I love this brand, LANIEGE. I have tried several of their products in the past. This was appealing to me since I have sensitive and dry skin. I have been using it for a week now and appreciate that it doesn't have a fragrance. It goes on really smoothly and is a thick consistency. Not sticky. Going into the winter months, I was looking for something a little thicker and that would help protect my skin barrier. So far, so good. Will update after I have used it for a while longer."
Cica Sleeping Mask,12-Nov-25,"I'm a big fan of Laneige products! I started with the Lip mask, then tinted serum. Then the Water Sleeping Mask became part of my regular PM routine. This Cica Sleeping Mask is very similar to the water mask, but according to Laneige, is designed for those with sensitive skin or to help with redness. I don't have naturally sensitive skin, but sometimes my use of retinols as well as glycolic peels can make my skin slightly irritated, so I thought this would be a great product to try. It's a nice consistency and goes on like the water mask. It absorbed well into my skin without leaving that slightly tacky feeling that you get from some nighttime products. After waking up, my skin felt great and was very smooth. Also like the water mask, this product suggests rinsing it off in the morning, but I never do that. I work from home, so most days I don't wear makeup and I've not had any issues from leaving the product on my skin. Just the opposite... I think it's actually helped with long term hydration. These products may seem slightly expensive, but compared to a number of the higher end skin care products I've used, they are great value. One jar will last you a few months. If you have sensitive skin and need additional hydration or help with redness, I would definitely order this. Even if you don't have sensitive skin, there are benefits to this version of the mask versus the other."
Cica Sleeping Mask,11-Nov-25,"Huge fan of LANEIGE, one of the top, and first to make a US impact, K-beauty lines. While they're probably best known for their amazing lip balms, everything I've tried from the brand has been at least good, and much of it great. And, bonus, at least in luxury makeup brand terms, relatively reasonably priced as well.

This new soothing cica-based night cream is no exception. Great for sensitive or combination skin, these soothing night cream moisturizers and helps reduce redness and irritation, either from sun or other damage, or breakouts. Lightweight, absorbs fast, and doesn't make an acne problem worse, it also helps smooth skin and reduce the appearance of pores. A perfect combo to use after an AHA exfoliating treatment, and won't break the bank."
Cica Sleeping Mask,11-Nov-25,"I have very sensitive skin to the point that I can only try one new skin care product at a time to identify the irritant and stop using it. I¡¯ve had to rule out plenty of popular gentle serums, sunscreens, moisturizers. Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask is a skin soothing mask that leaves my skin soft in the morning. It is non-irritating and does not block pores. I will be using this throughout the winter to stay moisturized. (50+, F, dry/normal skin)"
Cica Sleeping Mask,11-Nov-25,"I¡¯ve been using the LANEIGE Cica Sleeping Mask for several weeks, and it¡¯s an excellent choice for sensitive or reactive skin. The fragrance-free formula is a big improvement from past versions. Truly no scent, no tingling, and no redness the next morning.
The texture is a rich balm-cream, but it doesn¡¯t feel heavy or greasy.
I use it 2?3 times a week as a final step in my nighttime routine, and a little goes a long way. This mask has quickly become my go to for recovery nights when my skin needs extra comfort.
Overall, a soothing, effective overnight treatment that delivers visible hydration and calm which is ideal for anyone with sensitive, stressed, or barrier-compromised skin."
Cica Sleeping Mask,09-Nov-25,"I've tried a number of different moisturizers for my dry skin and this one is very good. It goes on as a heavy white cream and takes awhile to fully absorb and disappear. But the result is a noticeably softer skin. After it is absorbed there is a barely noticeable fragrance.

I'm not using it as a nighttime sleeping cream but as as regular daytime moisturizer. This is not a thin product like hand lotion. It is a cream, and a little bit goes a long way.

It really does do an excellent job moisturizing."
Cica Sleeping Mask,09-Nov-25,"I¡¯ve been using this overnight mask for a few weeks, and I am genuinely impressed. My skin feels instantly softer and looks noticeably healthier each morning. The texture is rich and luxurious, yet it absorbs beautifully without feeling heavy or sticky.

I love how easy it is to incorporate into my nightly routine?it leaves my face feeling replenished and comfortable all night long. Even after long, stressful days, my skin wakes up looking refreshed, calm, and radiant.

This product has truly elevated my skincare routine. It¡¯s a must-have for anyone looking to boost hydration and wake up with smoother, more balanced skin!"
Cica Sleeping Mask,09-Nov-25,"This is an easy way to give your face some overnight moisture without strong scents or greasy / unpleasant feeling. I tried this and was impressed with how easily it massages into my skin. It doesn't take a whole lot to cover so hopefully it will last a while. Once there, it immediately gives your face a feeling of moisture. In the morning, it comes off in the shower, and leaves the face feeling more refreshed. As we get older, our skin just shows signs of age. This helps to offset some of that. The quality is that of higher priced sleeping masks, so this is a nice find. From my experience, Koreans as a whole tend to make good quality skin care products, and this one is no exception."
Cica Sleeping Mask,08-Nov-25,"I am totally obsessed with LANEIGE products. I¡¯ve used both the WATER BANK and FIRM & BOUNCY sleeping masks (love the F&B lip so much it¡¯s on subscription!) so I definitely have some experience with these products and have used them long enough to compare them.

While the FIRM (souffl? cream) and WATER (gel-like) have lighter consistencies, the CICA has the consistency of a thick, rich cream, and feels like the most moisturizing formula you can think of (it reminds me of BumBum cream). It does a phenomenal job of hydrating and moisturizing-even better than the WATER and FIRM. It glides on easily and just feels like luxurious. Dry skin types: you¡¯re going to want to bathe in it!

It has zero detectable fragrance (the FIRM has a light scent) so it¡¯s definitely formulated for sensitive skin (which I don¡¯t have, but I do gravitate towards little to no fragrance skincare).
After using nightly for a week, I had zero irritation and woke up to very moisturized skin. I also sleep on a silk pillowcase and try to sleep on my back because even the best products can seep into your pillows if you¡¯re not careful!

Ultimately I don¡¯t have the type of redness that this product is meant for- I rarely breakout, and any redness on my face is caused by tiny capillaries (I¡¯m in my mid 40s and just started noticing them). This mask might work for Rosacea though, and definitely for acne prone types.

Overall, this is a very nice product- but doesn¡¯t do much for me other than moisturize. I like it better than the WATER (which hydrated my skin, but didn¡¯t moisturize, so I was still dry), but I prefer the FIRM because it addressed my main concerns (moisturizing, plumping, and fine line reducing), and I actually saw some positive results.

If you have sensitive skin, and looking for a beautifully moisturizing sleeping mask- give this one a try! It¡¯s even relatively affordable (even more so with the subscription)."
Cica Sleeping Mask,07-Nov-25,"I have combination dry/oily skin and this product goes on really well, not oily or sticky. It gives me great hydration through the night and my skin looks refreshed in the morning. They have funny advertising for this product, saying it's ""sleep mode for stressed skin"". My skin isn't stressed, or at least I don't think so, but I do like the results in the morning. It hasn't made my skin break out or anything so I'll continue using this and update the review if results are different down the road."
Cica Sleeping Mask,07-Nov-25,"I just started using the Laneige Cica Sleeping Mask, and I can already tell it¡¯s going to be a must in my nighttime routine. My skin¡¯s been feeling a little sensitive and dry lately, but this mask has been amazing for calming everything down overnight. It¡¯s packed with Forest Yeast (a cica-derived ingredient) that helps repair the skin barrier and soothe irritation. I wake up with my skin feeling noticeably softer and less red. The shea butter and squalane give it that deep hydration without feeling greasy, and it actually locks in moisture really well while I sleep. I also love that it¡¯s fragrance free and made for sensitive skin, so I don¡¯t have to worry about reactions or flare ups. Even after just a few nights, my skin looks more balanced and feels more resilient. It¡¯s one of those products that makes your skin feel ¡°reset¡± in the morning. I am so glad I tried this!"
Cica Sleeping Mask,07-Nov-25,"Full disclosure, I am a giant Laneige fan. Their sleeping lip mask is honestly my fave thing in the world. When I had the chance to try their sleep face mask, I knew I had to try it. This is a heavy duty dense mask. It feels amazing going on and is still present in the morning. After showering, my skin feels soft and supple. It really is nice. CICA is an anti-inflammatory and helps strengthen your skins moisture barrier so it makes sense. This stuff will last a long time because it shouldn¡¯t be used more than 2-3x a week. Laneige is a wonderful Korean company. I have or have used a number of their products and all of them are top notch especially for the money. This night mask is no exception. Strongly recommend."
Cica Sleeping Mask,06-Nov-25,"I just tried this sleeping mask last night and it is wonderful. I woke up and looked in the mirror to see my face looking rested and refreshed. Was it even possible that the dark circles under my eyes were less noticeable and the skin around the corners of my mouth appeared plumper, the fine lines not as visible? Possibly. It probably helped that I also had a decent night's sleep, but I won't argue with how soft my skin was or how refreshed I looked.
I didn't notice any smell at all with this sleeping mask. When I applied it, it simply felt silky, cooling, and refreshing on my face. I'd never tried a sleeping mask before, so I can't offer any comparisons, but I sure liked the way this one felt.
Here are the 2 reasons I didn't give it 4 stars:
1) The only instructions on the box said ""Apply evenly across face. Leave overnight and rinse off in the morning."" However, their website instructs that you moisturize your skin first, before applying this sleeping mask.
2) The jar is labeled 2.02 fluid ounces. However, if you saw this on a store shelf, you might be tricked into thinking the jar is filled with product. Not so. As you can see in the photos, there's sort of a jar-within-a-jar that holds a smaller amount of the product. It really bugs me when cosmetics companies do this, as it seems deceptive to me. My first photo shows the bottom of the jar and the ""bubble"" that is the inner jar holding the product. Photo 2 shows a side view of the inner jar.
So yes, it's a nice product, if you don't mind that this company, like so many others, may be resorting to a bit of visual trickery."
Cica Sleeping Mask,06-Nov-25,"This product is called a sleeping mask for facial skin hydration at night, but I also tried it for daytime use, and I was pleased with the results both ways. The mask came well sealed and the product is thicker than any other moisturizer I currently own. It is very creamy and went on so smoothly. I have rather sensitive skin, and I didn't feel any irritation with this cream. It made my skin feel soft and took that dry feeling away. It absorbs well and does not feel greasy. With the fall season in full swing and the air getting drier by the day, I decided to try this product as a thicker moisturizer under my daytime makeup. This cream does leave a shine on my skin, but under a thin liquid matte finish makeup with just a touch of powder over the top, it left my skin feeling soft and held up well under the makeup (without appearing overly shiny). I will most likely use this mostly at night, but it will be great to have around for daytime use as the really cold and dry weather hits. This is a small amount of cream even though it is placed is a comparatively large container, but the quality ingredients and the effect it has on my skin, make it worth the price."
Cica Sleeping Mask,06-Nov-25,"When I applied this to my skin before bed the product absorbed into my skin quickly. Later I noticed that my skin felt very smooth. This is interesting because my skin wasn¡¯t rough before nor did it have a grainy texture but the difference in how it felt was impossible to miss. I decided to apply it to my hands because they¡¯re starting to show signs of age. The next morning both my face and hands were soft, hydrated, and looked better. I love the suppleness and feel of my skin. I intend to continue using this product to see what results I can get from long term use. I¡¯m pleased to say that a little goes a long way so this is well worth the money."
Cica Sleeping Mask,01-Nov-25,New formula gives me red splotches and hives
Cica Sleeping Mask,11-Oct-25,"I will update after I use longer. Used a handful of times now and I love it. The texture is nice and soothing, not oily, not sticky and gives great hydration. I have sensitive combo skin that tends to get drier as I age but I still have big pores on my cheeks. I took a chance and bought during the prime sale bc I was ready to shake up my routine and have heard good things about this brand. I¡¯ve been using ZO for years and while I love it, my skin needs a boost and something different. Also, ZO is pricey so it will be nice to find a less expensive brand to supplement with."
Cica Sleeping Mask,23-Dec-25,"Overall: Great for daily use. I apply this as a moisturizer before bed and even though it is a sleeping mask, I put a generous amount on my face and there's not much to wash off in the morning. This might be because of the drier environments here in Toronto during the winter.

Pros: - Comes in a tight seal container and doesn't take too much product to cover the whole face. The product is on the thicker side but as expected since its supposed to stay on all night and to be removed in the morning. Face does feel moisturized after applying the product. The jar will last me a long time even though I put a generous amount. There is a slight scent to it and I kind of prefer it. This might be the smell of the fermented forest yeast.

Cons: - I believe it's supposed to come with a small spatula as shown in previous images and I'm not sure if this is from the newer design. Taking one star off because of this. Kept the product as the jar was sealed properly."
Cica Sleeping Mask,07-Dec-25,"I love this stuff. I live in Calgary and so I struggle with dry skin on my face all the time. I basically use this as my daily moisturizer and love it. It is lightweight, soothing and has healed all the dry patches on my face. I also feel like it doesn't clog my pores. I used to buy the tatcha brand of night cream but it was too expensive. This laneige product works the same for half the cost so it's a winner in my eyes!"
Cica Sleeping Mask,07-Dec-25,Love it
Cica Sleeping Mask,05-Dec-25,Perfect cream for dry winter. Finally found the cream that works well on my skin
Cica Sleeping Mask,09-Nov-25,"I am from Alberta Canada, where it is so dry. This product has helped my dry skin in the winter immensely. I wear it during the day as well because I work outside and have found it¡¯s the only thing that will keep my skin nourished. Why I didn¡¯t give it 5 stars is the jar is very large for the amount of product you get. I think they could cut down on packaging."
