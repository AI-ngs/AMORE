Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,"Y¡¯all. I¡¯ve tried so many cheaper alternatives before purchasing this and ended up spending more money on things that don¡¯t work instead of just getting this. Don¡¯t waste your money on a bunch of random lip masks you¡¯ll hope works out. My lips have been through it this winter, cracked and bleeding everyday. I¡¯ve used this for less than a week and my lips are feeling brand new already. No more pain and bleeding! Smells great. And I¡¯ve had issues with other lip products breaking me out around my mouth but this one is great for sensitive skin. I literally never review but I finally caved in and got this product since everyone raves about it and I am happy I did! It was worth it and it comes with a lot of product so the price isn¡¯t that bad actually"
Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,Have been using this lip mask for years in all flavors. Love them!
Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,Best flavor yet like a grape skittle
Lip Sleeping Mask,22-Dec-25,So refreshing! Lips are so soft! Smells good too.
Lip Sleeping Mask,21-Dec-25,Absolutely TERRIBLE! Caused extreme burns on my lips. I was blaming a lipstick I was wearing but it turns out it was the lip mask that I paid 24.00 !!! Awful product!
Lip Sleeping Mask,21-Dec-25,"I purchase this every year during Prime day sales. I like it, it feels nice but if i¡¯m honest, I have not noticed much of a difference from it,
I use it every night before bed and it last a long time but if it wasn¡¯t for the sale I would not buy this brand. I have the Elf lip mask as well and it is very nice."
Lip Sleeping Mask,21-Dec-25,"Tengo 38 a?os, y llevo dos semanas usando el contorno de ojos y tambi?n le aplico a mi esposo, y las l?neas finas se han atenuado en ambos. Gran producto !"
Lip Sleeping Mask,20-Dec-25,Very expensive for what it is.
Lip Sleeping Mask,20-Dec-25,Keeps lips smooth! It's great! Wonderful flavor.
Lip Sleeping Mask,20-Dec-25,"I love this lip mask it's my favorite ""go to"" for chapped lips. It smells great & I love the buttery softness. Check it out bet you'll love it too!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,Incredible sleep mask for dry lips or to just keep your lips moist on a daily basis. I never miss a night putting it on before going to bed. Amazing product feel and scent.
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,I love is mask. Hydrating and makes my lips soft.
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,This is a fun Christmas gift---I love the original pot of sleeping mask but these minis seem like a nice little Christmas remembrance for friends.
Lip Sleeping Mask,19-Dec-25,doesn't stay on while sleeping.
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"This stuff is great. It¡¯s one of the only glosses that doesn¡¯t wear off immediately. I use it every night before bed and I still feel it the next morning. Not greasy or heavy, smells wonderful and doesn¡¯t taste bad. I love it and will buy again."
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Its nice I guess, I'm not seeing the hype tho to be honest. I take good care of my skin and lips and wanted to try it out for a long time, but honestly I've had better results by using jojoba oil or something similar. The packaging and smell is wonderful though"
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,Good product but the minis are more worth it. The packaging is portrayed as if the container is full but they have the entire bottom of the container al carved out. There is only a few uses in each one. I understand the point of samples. But this is false advertising.
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Great product, makes a great stocking stuffer!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,Wore only for a few hrs my lips were really dry and now it¡¯s smooth!!! Lips are hydrated!love this!
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"I've been using this at bedtime for about a month. My very dry and peeling lips improved immediately and are staying smooth and not peeling. it comes with a little applicator, but I put a tiny amount on my pinky finger and apply. It is the best product i have ever used for lips. I got the ""berry"" version - light pink color and very subtle berry taste/fragrance."
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Los amo
Buena compra"
Lip Sleeping Mask,18-Dec-25,"Been a fan of Laneige for years - you don't have to ""sleep"" to love this lip gel! Smooth + creamy, great flavor; i am addicted to lip products, this is definitely one of my faves!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,Muy buena para idratata tus labios
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,I had high hopes for this base on the reviews. I have been trying every product know to man for chapped lips. This product in pricey and it didn't help my chapped lips at all. Definitely disappointed in this after spending over $20 on it and it had so many good reviews. Works well as a pretty gloss though. If you need help with chapped lips I recommend Okeefes and it is super inexpensive.
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"This stuff is like gold. Especially during the winter, my lips get so so dry. I haven't found anything else that helps as much as Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask. Do yourself a favor and buy this product!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"Laneige lip sleeping mask lives up to its name and reputation. I love its long lasting, glossy finish and scent that leaves my lips feel softer and hydrated in the morning."
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,I've used this off and on throughout the years. It's fantastic. I also use it on my cuticles. I'm sticking with it now.
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"I love this lip mask. I recommend it all the time! The tub is nice instead of a squeeze tube because you are less likely to waste. The price is not cheap, but I have been using the same little tub for probably 2 years and haven¡¯t had to buy a new one yet! Very moisturizing but doesn¡¯t feel too thick. Smells great and usually last all night!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"The LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask is an excellent product for anyone dealing with dry or chapped lips. The texture is rich yet lightweight, and it feels very comfortable on the lips without being sticky. After applying it before bed, lips feel noticeably softer, smoother, and deeply hydrated by morning.

The Gummy Bear scent is pleasant and subtle, adding a fun touch without being overpowering. A little product goes a long way, making the jar last for a long time. The formula locks in moisture overnight and helps repair dryness, especially during colder weather."
Lip Sleeping Mask,17-Dec-25,"This is obviously witch magic. It literally heals my lips in mere hours. I am a new woman in cold, dry Colorado winters"
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and this product really does live up to it. It makes my lips feel incredibly smooth and soft, even after just one use.

I especially struggle with dry, cracked lips in the winter, and this keeps my lips moisturized and comfortable overnight. I wake up with lips that feel noticeably healthier and crack-free.

A little goes a long way, and it¡¯s quickly become a must-have in my nightly routine."
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"Do not recommend this product. It doesn't help your lips at all. I have been using it religiously for the last 2 months, and I have not noticed any changes. I continue to need chapstick throughout the day and Vaseline before even applying this before bed. I also scanned the barcode on this item and it is extremely toxic to humans and the environment ! I will never be buying this product again and I highly do not recommend it. In the trash it goes !"
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,This is a product that lives up to the advertising. Makes your lips look and feel amazing.
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"Used it last night and so far so good. I saw a dramatic improvement in my lips. My lips have never been this cracked and dry ever in my life, so I was desperate for something that would work."
Lip Sleeping Mask,16-Dec-25,"This should not be a product for sale. If anything, it could be a gift with other purchases since this is a sample size.
Not only it¡¯s extremely small. But once you see the bottom, IT¡¯S EVEN SMALLER!!!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Best stuff ever buy this set
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Love this stuff.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,A friend recommended this for overnight use and I¡¯ve used it ever since.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"I bought this after seeing an influencer share it saying it was one of her favorite things and that she has used it nightly for over a decade. I found that my lips got SO DRY and cracked when I used this. I wanted to love it, but I just hated it instead. It had the opposite effect on my lips from what it is meant for, sadly. I used it nightly for about 2 weeks and as soon as I stopped using it, my lips healed and were no longer dry and cracked."
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,My daughter loves this.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Best lip sleeping mask
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"I didn't realize when I ordered it that it was 3 flavors in one and it is amazing, very hydrating, light on the sent, doesn't bother my sensitive skin. The only down side is the price it is quite pricey but worth the spurlge every once in a while."
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"Best night, lip mask ever!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Great product!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,This is my favorite scent
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Great stocking stuffer!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"All I can say is I live eat and breathe with this stuff now. I really like the sleeping mask for my lips. I wake up and my lips are not dry anymore. When I¡¯m getting close to running out, I always buy another one. I can honestly say that if I had to do this on TikTok, it would be a true review. I highly recommend the LANEIGE lip sleeping mask!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,My favorite lip product!! So smooth and feels amazing!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Works wonders
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Arrived in very damaged box but product okay.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,These are the best lip mask but I was worried the chocolate might be overpowering. It wasn¡¯t it was perfect and now one of my favorites.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Fantastic trial sizes!!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,This was given as a gift to someone that uses Burts Bees. This works so much better!
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,Just feels like an overpriced lip balm that didn¡¯t do much for me.
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,"Love these! Slight tint of color. I use these as a gloss, not a mask"
Lip Sleeping Mask,15-Dec-25,I wear a c-pap for sleep apnea each night. The gel helps my problem with dry lips.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love it!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Love this mask I use it daily for a lip gloss to keep my lips hydrated. I wish it had an applicator or you could dispense it differently instead of sticking your finger in it to get the product out. Overall I love this, my go to!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,As expected and wonderful product!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great mask!!!good price!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This product is always a hit! Pricey but lasts a very long time. I have bought this repeatedly for friends.
And it works."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Honestly wouldn¡¯t buy again, it definitely has a great texture to it but the only thing it did for me was dry my lips out ??"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Smells great and keeps my lips hydrated! I use this every night (and often during the day). I¡¯m on my third tub of it!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Smells great, works great, feels great."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"These are exactly as described. A bit pricey and doesn't last long, but I do like them."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Second purchase . Use this every night to prevent lip dryness
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love this lip product!!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Great product ,she loves it"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This is such a good lip mask! I slather my lips up when they need some extra hydration, or just in general in the winter, and it never fails to help rehydrate my lips. I have repurchased this lip mask at least 3 times at this point! The jar lasts a long time too."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Works great especially overnight! Can be used in dry cuticles too ??
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Felt moisturizing on my lips. This completes my night time skin care routine. Smells good also.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This sleep mask has been a game changer. It is extremely hydrating, and not sticky."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,LOVE! You can use this for the most glossy lips - not just at night time.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,I¡¯m addicted to this stuff! So good!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,If you use it like its meant it works. It hydrates your lips. Don't expect them to be all shiny that's only right after you put it on. It starts off feeling kinda slimy.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Cute set, perfect for a gift. The eye mask container is much larger than the smaller sized face mask, so just be aware of that - the face mask is more of a deluxe sample size. The lip mask was nice as well."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,loving so far!! it¡¯s working great. and the smell is INCREDIBLE!!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"I was starting to notice some slight wrinkles around my lips which freaked me out, but this Laneige lip mask has made a huge difference and now I refuse to go without it. It does last me a few months and I use it every night. Also so helpful during the winter months to keep your lips soft and protected."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Lasted me a long time but a little more pricey for what it¡¯s worth - there are comparable products, but you are paying for the name brand. I honestly also used outside of sleeping as a hydrator! Still lasted me forever."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love this stuff!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,This is my favorite brand. I love this sleep mask. It keeps my lips well hydrated and smooth.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"Second bottle, great product"
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,I¡¯m a CPAP user and my lips get horridly dry from my full face mask. I just discovered this lip mask and it¡¯s been a godsend. I don¡¯t even have to use it every night as it seems to heal my lips and keep them moisturized.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,This is one of my favorite beauty products
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great lip mask for night time nourishment to your lips! I use it every night and never worry about chapped or cracking lips from the cold.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Best sleeping mask. Only product I use.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"During season changes, my lips get very dry. The lip mask leaves my lips highly hydrated. The mask comes in a cute glass bottle and the applicator. My boyfriend and I have incorporated this to our bedtime routine. Highly recommend."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great product! I use nightly and haven¡¯t had chapped lips.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Nice smooth texture
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Great product - keeps my lips soft in the winter
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,My go to product for my lips. I use every morning. I don¡¯t have to worry about dry lips. The smell is nice and goes on smoothly. Have been using for a couple years. Would highly recommend!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,A lot smaller than I expected but great quality! Love Laneige!
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,"This is a very popular item for lip treatment, it says it's just for at night. But I use it for during the day too."
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,This is so amazing! I would highly recommend the lip moisturizer.
Lip Sleeping Mask,14-Dec-25,Love this. It works great on my lips.
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,Love the way it makes my lips feel. Goes on smoothly!
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,"Does this product seem a little pricey? Sure. However, even with nightly use it lasts me for at LEAST a full year, which works out to just pennies a day. How many makeup/beauty products do you have that last that long? And it works. Even in our dry midwestern winters my lips felt so good. My daughter tends to get severely chapped lips sometimes in winter, made worse by licking them and ends up with a lot of rawness around her lips...this completely eliminated the problem for her.
Still, I thought 'surely a less expensive product would do just as well?' So when my Laneige ran out I purchased a drugstore dupe that looked nearly identical. Ugh. I've tried to tolerate it, but the sticky, petroleum jelly feeling and taste are too strong. My lips feel okayish, but the sticky sensation when putting it on at night means I am not going to use this as an occasional lip balm during the day ever, unlike the Laneige. I'm not about to put up with this for as long as it takes me to use up the drugstore product; I'm reordering my Laneige."
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,Must have. Can¡¯t live without
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,"Love all the products, especially the eye mask!"
Lip Sleeping Mask,13-Dec-25,Use this all the time
Lip Glowy Balm,23-Dec-25,He probado muchos incluso de marcas famosas pero ninguno es tan bueno como este
Lip Glowy Balm,22-Dec-25,"These are by far the best lip gloss¡¯ around, my lips feel nice and moisturized after applying. With so many flavors to pick from you cannot go wrong."
Lip Glowy Balm,22-Dec-25,My lips feel dry after wearing the lip balm
Lip Glowy Balm,21-Dec-25,"I¡¯ve been loving the LANEIGE Lip Glowy Balm in Peach Iced Tea ? it gives a light, glossy tint while keeping lips hydrated all day.
Perfect if you want a natural look with moisture and shine, without heavy lipstick."
Lip Glowy Balm,20-Dec-25,I love it it last couple hours good smell taste and color it¡¯s amazing
Lip Glowy Balm,20-Dec-25,Good brand Xmas gift for granddaughter
Lip Glowy Balm,19-Dec-25,"Winter absolutely destroys my lips. Between cold air, wind, heat blasting in the car, and dry indoor air, they crack fast and stay mad about it. This Lip Glowy Balm is the one thing that actually brings them back to life overnight ?
The texture is glossy but not sticky, and it melts in quickly without feeling heavy. I put it on before bed and wake up with lips that feel soft, hydrated, and normal again, not tight or flaky. And yes, it still feels good in the morning, which says a lot. I keep one in my car for emergency lip situations and another on my bedside table because I¡¯m gonna forget if I don¡¯t. The squeeze tube makes it easy to apply without digging a finger into a pot, and a little goes a long way. The berry tint is subtle and pretty, nothing loud, just healthy looking lips ??
If winter dries out your lips like it does mine, this is a must. It¡¯s one of those products you don¡¯t realize you rely on until it¡¯s gone, and then suddenly everything feels wrong ?? Highly recommend for cold weather, travel, or anyone who wakes up with crusty lips no matter what they do."
Lip Glowy Balm,18-Dec-25,"I get this product all the time and while it might be a bit of a splurge, it is worth it!!! The whole thing lasts about 3 months so it's great for the price. Unlike other balms, this one stays on for a while, and no reapplications are necessary! While this product is not a lip mask, it works great before you go to to bed in the night, and keeps your lips moisturized the whole time. Absolutely amazing!"
Lip Glowy Balm,18-Dec-25,I give this a ten out of ten
Lip Glowy Balm,18-Dec-25,"Very thick, moisturizing formula, smells good, and softens lips almost instantly! I will be buying another soon"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,"Love the quality of this gloss, easy glide on, not sticky at all, perfect color"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,"This lip mask is the BOMB! It¡¯s. It¡¯s not tacky at all, smells great and goes nicely over a lip stain to give your lips a nice little shine. It¡¯s also great if you live in a dry climate environment like Colorado. Your lips will thank you!"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,got this on sale and the product is super nice
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,It¡¯s excellent
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,"Nice neutral tone, it¡¯s like a super sheer purple. Looks clear almost"
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,I love it
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,Loveee & smells so good.
Lip Glowy Balm,17-Dec-25,Good quality lip balm.
Lip Glowy Balm,16-Dec-25,My favorite lip balm! The Laneige lip balm adds a little color to my lips and keeps them moisturized! I gift it to all of my friends!
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Love this product! The color looks perfect
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"Love this lip balm! We buy so many of these. We love the feel of it, smell and the applicator is my favorite! Can¡¯t get enough!"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,I have Tried several lip balms. This is number one on my list. Last long and I use it mostly at night after a good lip scrub. I tend to have dryer lips and those works amazing.
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"The Laneige Lip Glowy Balm is a lightweight, hydrating lip balm with a glossy finish. It¡¯s designed to feel more like a lip gloss crossed with a balm ? moisturizing lips while giving a subtle tint and shiny look. It¡¯s enriched with nourishing butters like shea butter and murumuru seed butter for hydration."
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Great product. Effective for lip care
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"This lip balm lives in my bag now. It¡¯s super hydrating without being sticky, gives the perfect sheer tint, and makes my lips look healthy and glossy with zero effort. I love that it feels lightweight but actually lasts, especially for dry lips. It¡¯s my go-to for everyday errands, school drop-offs, or when I want a little something without doing full makeup. So good?I¡¯ve already repurchased. My favorite flavor is Gummy Bear!"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Love the smell. But is a bit stickier than the potted one
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"I love this product! Out of all the lip glosses I¡¯ve bought throughout my life, this has been the only lipgloss that doesn¡¯t get stuck to everything it touches. It¡¯s not sticky, it¡¯s hydrating and adds a great glossy pink color to the lips. I got the shade ¡®berry¡¯ and it smells great but not in an overwhelming way. Will buy again- in a couple months because a little goes a long way!"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,"i like this lip balm but it is a little bit sticky sometimes, i like the color and scent"
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,I returned it. Very sticky and strong scent
Lip Glowy Balm,15-Dec-25,Daughter loves this
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"My new fav! I love this balm, and this gummy bear is my new fav!"
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Kinda drying
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"I¡¯m a little disappointed because I was hoping the peach scent would be stronger, but it¡¯s barely noticeable. Formula-wise, it¡¯s still decent, and the packaging color is really cute! Sadly, this will just be an added collector piece to my growing Laneige lip balm collection. ??????"
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Cute light color
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Love this color tint and flavor. Almost makes your teeth look whiter because of the hue!
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Love it! Smooth lips no chapping and it doesn¡¯t wipe off instantly!
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Nice product
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"The matcha is a fun addition to the Laneige line up! I would definitely purchase this one again - and no, you don¡¯t have green tinted lips when applying it. It¡¯s sheer and hydrating with a subtle scent. I love the consistency."
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,My favorite lip balm. Very moisturizing.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,My absolute favorite lip balm! Maybe don¡¯t love the chocolate one as much.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Nice
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,what she wanted!
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,"Love this product, adds light color and protects dry lips."
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Feels so good on lips
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Bought as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter. She swears by the Laneige Lip Moisturizers and Sleep Masks for lip hydration and repair.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,I was influenced to try this out since I wouldn't normally pay this much for a lip balm. Well I will not be able to go back to any others because this one is just so nice. It's not super long lasting but it is so soft and smooth and has a pleasant berry scent (not overpowering). It has a bit of a taste if you get some in your mouth but its not unpleasant. I like how it doesnt feel super sticky as well. I love this and will keep repurchasing.
Lip Glowy Balm,14-Dec-25,Love this gloss. I¡¯m in my third purchase.
Lip Glowy Balm,13-Dec-25,"I love this lip balm. Its more like a gloss. Feels great, not sticky at all and very moisturizing"
Lip Glowy Balm,13-Dec-25,"This stuff is amazing and is one of the few cosmetic items ill ¡°splurge¡± on. I normally get elf/maybelline/etc but my mom uses Laneige religiously and so I bought her this for a stocking stuffer Christmas 2024. She loves it so much and let me use some. Applies thick but so smooth, once its on you dont feel it heavy but it is doing what it needs to do. Looks so cute on but still suttle! Bought it again for this Christmas (25) and just know shell love it."
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,"Love Laneige products, this set is great!"
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,"This lip balm delivers impressive moisture without feeling heavy. The berry scent is subtle and refreshing, and the glossy finish leaves lips looking healthy and smooth. A reliable everyday lip essential"
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,Loved it so much and my boyfriend stole it! I had to buy two more so I will always have one around.
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,We love laneige lip products. Super hydrating and look great too. My daughters steal mine every time I get a new flavor/color!
Lip Glowy Balm,12-Dec-25,Couldn¡¯t say enough good things about this gloss! It has lasted me so long and is the perfect tint!
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,"I have used the grapefruit one for years. Never tried the others because it worked. But as ARMY fan from BTS, I saw that JK uses the gummy bear one. I needed one for my car so why not? I love it. I love the formula already for not being sticky, more like slick oil. And the sweet candy smell is good. Is colorless, tasteless to me and it last a decent time like a balm not a big lip gloss. It's an every day lip product, and I reapply after eating mostly."
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,I love the consistency. It is sheer though
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,"Great, but overpriced. You could probably find the same ingredients and effectiveness in a korean brand for a third of the price. Also wouldn't be advertised by someone who sympathizes with a certain european historical figure's struggle."
Lip Glowy Balm,11-Dec-25,"Super hydrating, adds a pretty shine, smooth feel, perfect for daily use."
Lip Glowy Balm,10-Dec-25,"I am absolutely obsessed with this lipgloss, I¡¯ve tried so many others including summer Fridays but I keep returning to this exact one. It has the perfect amount of light pink tint and actually hydrates your lips!! I¡¯ve probably gone through 10 tubes of this by now!"
Lip Glowy Balm,10-Dec-25,"Love this balm, very hydrating and soft"
Lip Glowy Balm,10-Dec-25,I love everything Laneige and this is no exception. A gift for my teen daughter - it got 2 thumbs up. We live in a dry climate and lips stay moisturized and smells good!
Lip Glowy Balm,09-Dec-25,"Comfortable and moisturizing balm. It's not sticky, but still lasts on the lips for awhile."
Lip Glowy Balm,09-Dec-25,THE BEST LIP GLOSS! I've tried everything and this gloss is in my top three!
Lip Glowy Balm,09-Dec-25,Didn¡¯t find anything special about this gloss. Price too high
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,Love all of these ! Best lip product
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,Dont buy into the hype. Its sticky and very very very lightly tinted. Tube is very small for $19. Smells good though.
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,"Smells great, doesn¡¯t stay on lips long, I have to reapply frequently. Nice shine without being sticky."
Lip Glowy Balm,08-Dec-25,The best lip balm ever. I¡¯ve tried everything from Summer Fridays to aquaphor and I always come back to Laneige. All the flavors are good and it¡¯s not sticky. It looks good over lipstick and last a long time! This is probably my 12th time buying. I¡¯m not even embarrassed about it!!
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"I decided to try the LANEIGE Lip Glowy Balm in Gummy Bear after seeing Jungkook from BTS rave about it - if it's good enough for him, I figured it was worth a shot!
What I liked:
The scent is lovely and not overpowering, and the Gummy Bear shade gives a nice sheer tint of color. The texture feels smooth going on, and it has a lightweight, glossy finish. The packaging is sleek and easy to toss in a bag.
What didn't work for me:
I have really dry lips and was hoping this would be a game-changer, but I've only used it a few times since purchasing. For my level of dryness, it seems like this product needs consistent, frequent application to make a real difference. Since I often forget to reapply lip products throughout the day, I haven't seen the hydration results I was hoping for.
For comparison, I find that Vaseline Lip Therapy works better for my sporadic usage habits and delivers more intensive moisture when I need it. This LANEIGE balm also doesn't have much taste to it (which some might prefer, but I personally like a hint of flavor).
Bottom line:
If you're consistent with lip care and looking for a pretty, lightweight balm with a subtle tint, this could work well for you. For severely dry lips with inconsistent application, you might need something more heavy-duty."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"Hidrata bien, pero realmente no tiene color, solo es un brillo transparente bonito."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"For some reason this had like no scent at all. I have the berry scent and love it, but this smelt like literally nothing."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"When I first used this lip balm, I was very whelmed with its performance. It certainly did its job of hydrating my lips (without having to apply it 400 times a day), but I was unsure of whether its performance justified its price.

I neglected to remember that most products in the lip-care category are *checks notes* crap.

I was reminded of this fact when I misplaced this a little while back. While I tore up my living space looking for it, I got another lip balm, as being without lip care during the winter feels about as pleasant as falling down a flight of stairs. My replacement balm needed reapplication after 20 minutes, had a grainy texture, tasted horrible, and failed to do its one rudimentary task of hydrating my lips correctly. I eventually found my missing Laneige, and one application told me that it¡¯s 100% worth it (still try to get it on sale though).

It does the job its supposed to do, it doesn¡¯t need to be reapplied every three seconds, and less applications could make it more cost-effective to use in the long run. The flavor is also nice, but that doesn¡¯t matter as much as performance to me. I like products that work well, and seeing as I¡¯ve had this lip balm for two months and barely made a dent in the bottle (ignoring the fact that it spend a decent chunk of time being MIA), then this product may very well be joining my lineup of skincare staples."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"I did some research before buying this lip gloss, and it kept popping up as a top choice for a hydrating gloss that gives beautiful shine?and it totally lives up to the hype! I love how it makes my lips look fuller without any plumping effect, just a natural, fuller look. The formula is smooth and not at all sticky, which makes it super comfortable to wear.

It keeps my lips feeling hydrated for hours while giving them a lovely, glossy finish. It's become a daily go-to for me. If you're after a lip gloss that's moisturizing and gives that fuller look with a beautiful shine, this is definitely worth trying!"
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,"This LANEIGE Lip Glowy Balm gives a sheer, pretty tint while keeping my lips soft and hydrated all day. The shea butter formula feels lightweight but really nourishing, and the shine makes my lips look instantly smoother."
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,It really helps with chapped lips. It¡¯s never sticky or yucky on my lips. Makes my lips look so shiny and plump and just yesssss!!
Lip Glowy Balm,07-Dec-25,This is a staple for me. I always have one in my bag and vanity.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Granddaughter loves it so I¡¯m happy
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Gave to granddaughter (29 yrs old) and she loves it. She has dry lips and loves soft color.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,I love this color ?? it¡¯s just enough pink for a casual day out!
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Love this product! Delivered in box no issues with presentation. Arrived in a timely manner from seller.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,My favorite lip balm ever. Lasts for hours.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Really great this duo is worth it can't wait to make another purchase
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,Your lips look beautiful
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,"I¡¯m using this for a year, I love to purchase again"
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,This is the perfect gloss. Slight color tint. Not too sticky. Love!
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,This is a great daytime ¡°to go¡± version of the sleep mask. Lightweight and not sticky.
Lip Glowy Balm,06-Dec-25,So nice. It leave my lips with enough shine and it last a long time. There isn't a pink tint to it either
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Great lip balm however it is a bit overrated. Laniege a well known, popular brand that I like but it is not my favorite brand when it comes to lip products.

The product itself is cute and smells really good. The scent is one of the best things about it, the texture is very thick and velvety but sticky and too thick. It mosturizes my lips to a point but eventually it didn't make a difference. It may work differently depending on the skin type but it is still a good product I enjoy bringing around with me when I need it."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Lie this lip balm, gives my lip that pinky glossy look that I like. It last a pretty long time."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Me encanta brillo, no tiene color. Es s?per hidratante, huele muy bien y es de los mejores que he probado! Lo utilizo durante todo el a?o pero sobre todo en invierno y para dormir.. cuando despierto mis labios siguen hidratados. Lo ?nico malo es su precio¡¦ me parece excesivo."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"The tint is very, VERY sheer, but the balm is great quality. The flavor is light, not overwhelmingly sweet like balms for kids, but pleasant to wear. Keeps the lips nicely moisturized during the day, although I would recommend something heavier for winter weather or for overnight use. 9/10 and would buy again and again, definitely want to try the other flavors and tints!"
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"4 stars bc I love the vanilla and I love the formula of the lip masks and have bought them several times. However, BE WARNED: this brown lip mask is not sheer. It might look less awful on darker skin tones but on me (super pale) it looks like I've been eating... brown stuff."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,LOVE this balm! The formula is rich but not heavy leaving a fuller looking lips!
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Great lip balm, gives a beautiful glow on the lips."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,Love the sheet color. A little too soft so use care on how much pressure is used when applying. Great price.
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,One of my favorite lip balms
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,I love this. Keeps lips moist with a hint of color. I¡¯ve bought many for gifts.
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"Love this balm, it doesn't iritate my lips."
Lip Glowy Balm,05-Dec-25,"My absolute favorite lip gloss ever. It's thick enough that it stays on for a good amount of time but not overly thick that's it's too much. Just FYI, If you have long hair it will stick to your lips. It has the slightest hint of color. My go to over most, even my summer Friday's."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,22-Dec-25,"My daughter loves their lip products, and while she does like this gloss we were hoping it would be a little more pigmented, the color is extremely subtle."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,22-Dec-25,This lip serum really moisturizes and I love the color it is very subtle
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,22-Dec-25,Not sticky at all. Color is perfect and smells good.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,21-Dec-25,"Authentic and arrived perfectly, as listed and described."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,21-Dec-25,Not plumping if that¡¯s what you¡¯re looking for and slippery if you put too much but looks really good on.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Dec-25,"Love this lip serum! Perfect buildable color saturation, high gloss and excellent hydration. I also like that it does not have the ¡°fireball¡± sensation for the trending plumping effect that most glosses now have."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Dec-25,Me dije a mi misma que no comprar?a mas b?lsamos labiales y luego me top? con este!! De todos los que tengo (y tengo MUCHOS) este sin duda es mi favorito. Mis labios son secos como el desierto y este b?lsamo es el ?nico que realmente los hidrata. El olor es riqu?simo y la formula para nada pegajosa. Lo am?. ?????
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,19-Dec-25,"Smells great, rolls on smooth, subtle in color, makes lips nice and glossy."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,17-Dec-25,Donut shaped applicator makes it easy to apply the gloss ;)
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,15-Dec-25,"Love it, very nice color makes your lips look like you got a lip filler, hydradition is there, soft and Lucious, I love this it¡¯s great quality and size and everything."

Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Dec-25,Excellent glaze craze
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Dec-25,"This is one of my fav lip glosses by far! The smell of it is delicious! It leaves your lips soft and hydrated, not sticky! It doesn¡¯t last as long if you¡¯re drinking/eating. It gives that shine & love the color!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Dec-25,This product is by far my new favorite it makes your lips feel great ??
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,12-Dec-25,Gift for my daughter. This one is her favorite!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,LOVE IT AND IT LAST ALSO
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,"I bought the one called Maple syrup because I thought that was the coloring, I think it was but also I smell like I¡¯ve eaten pancakes every time I put it on my lips. Which is hilarious."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,"Literally smells like maple syrup! Or like I ate a maple bar lol. Super moisturizing and not too sticky. This keeps my lips hydrated and gives it a cute nude pink tint that still keeps the look subtle but can apply more of you want more gloss. A little goes a long way so I¡¯ve been able to keep it going throughout fall into winter. I love the little donut cushion applicator top too. Overall, great product even though a bit $$. I imagine I¡¯ll try the other shades/scents when I run out. For a medium neutral skin tone, I thought the maple glaze was perfect!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Dec-25,Very hydraiting with the perfect touch of color
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Dec-25,I kept this in my car. Both my sisters went on a road trip with me and purchased as they were in the car. They loved it so much.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Dec-25,These glaze craze lippies are some of my favorites. I have in multiple flavors. Love them all
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Dec-25,"great applicator and packaging of the product!
the balm is moisturizing all day long and very nice on the lips.
the color is a bit light for medium to dark skin tone, would be a great nude lip for everyday use!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Dec-25,My teen granddaughter loves it¡¦ color is not too much for a 13 year old
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,I like this brand and their lip mask line so I was excited to try this out. It works fine and looks good on my skin tone (brown) but it was so sticky I felt like it was clumping most of the evening and I would wipe it off and reapply. I won't buy this again but I'm happy to use it till it runs out.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,Love this product! Would buy again when I¡¯m done. Just enough amount of moisturization and shine
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,I got the fake once so returned it .
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Dec-25,Soft lips¡¦
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,Feels very nice in my lips. But it¡¯s a bit too pigmented for me. I have to do a small dot with another lip balm to get more of a subtly raspeberry look on my lips. I went to work early morning looking like a nuts case not realizing my lip gloss was everywhere and uneven lol
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,Moisturizing with the perfect gloss!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,It was not what I expected
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Dec-25,Smells absolutely amazing! Loved the product and the color!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Dec-25,Smells incredible and exactly like chocolate frosting!!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Dec-25,Smells INCREDIBLE. I love this product.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"Really only ordered it for the color, but I was delighted to discover it softened my chapped lips better than most of my other balms! Winner. I have two now. Bonus, the flavors are excellent"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Love this! Nice soft color
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Best lip gloss on the market but it is HIGHLY pigmented. Just beware if you are only looking for something to stop lip chapping like I was!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"I have chocolate glaze and later bought cinnamon maple because it¡¯s soooo good. The colors are sophisticated, the perfect mixture of pigment to sheer. They give a nice blurr effect as well. Only downside is price and scent if you¡¯re picky"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Good
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,Smells amazing and I would definitely repurchase
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"Love the applicator
Very limited - not a clear/light lip gloss"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"Nice color, not sticky and glides on well."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"The scent is really strong, and left me feeling nauseous. The color is beautiful, formula feels great and applicator very cool/effective. I¡¯m going to try to find a variation of this from Laneige but without scent. Such a pity."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"I love this color, especially for a light lip gloss that smells so good!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"It¡¯s a pretty color lip gloss , nothing special , liked the applicator"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Dec-25,"So cute, smells great, I think the price is a bit much but the jelly top is worth it! The gloss is thick and looks great. The lip gloss seems like it will have a nice longevity, the size is perfect for a pocket and the texture is nice and smooth."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love the shade and applicator! It smells good too. It doesn¡¯t last very long and it is a little sticky.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,"Beautiful color! Love the color on my lips, very sexy and this product keeps my lips hydrated."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love this stuff and the color is great. Not sticky and moisturizing. I¡¯m getting for all the girls in my family for chrismas!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love the pop of color and the way it feels. Keeps my lips hydrated and smooth in the dry winter months.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,Love this lip serum! Perfect fall shade . Would definitely buy again! I was glad to find it on sale!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,"Not a big fan. It goes on smooth and feels good for a little bit, but leaves your lips very dry. Not worth the money as it is not a cheap lip gloss."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,beautiful tint & very moisturizing for a lip gloss
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,04-Dec-25,"This is by far one of my favorite lip balms. The color is gorgeous, it¡¯s not sticky, and it lasts a long time. It also leaves your lips feeling super smooth. I highly recommend it!"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,03-Dec-25,This gloss feels really good on and the color is subtle but definitely visible (not completely sheer).
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,03-Dec-25,"Good color and smell, but sits on top of my lips and not hydrating. When my lips starts to dry, it would outline my cracked lips ??"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,01-Dec-25,Product doesn't last on the lips and doesn't hydrate my lips at all. If anything I find that my lips get drier after using this product. Waste of money.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,30-Nov-25,I think it¡¯s okay not that great. The color is weird
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,29-Nov-25,I like this lip serum. It gives good moist .
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,28-Nov-25,"Really wasn't impressed for the price. My dermatologist recommended Laneige to me for all my lip care needs. I do use the lip sleeping mask and was really excited to try this lipgloss. Sadly, there really is no actual colored tint to the ""Strawberry Sprinkles"" and the shine wears off in less than an hour without even eating or drinking. I really had high hopes for this product considering the cost but it fell short. Definitely would not purchase again unless at a steep discount.
Side note: It isn't sticky on your lips and is easy to apply and comfortable with the rolling lip ball. I just prefer more shine and a subtle pink tint which I have found with cheaper brands."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,28-Nov-25,Great lip gloss !
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,27-Nov-25,My favorite lip product. The color is perfect and it smells so good! Doesn¡¯t leave residue or that white ring some glosses do.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,26-Nov-25,Granddaughter loved
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,24-Nov-25,"This is worse than drug store gloss. Thin and over priced, just useless."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,23-Nov-25,good
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,21-Nov-25,Love this product
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Nov-25,Was a present for a preteen she loved it
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,20-Nov-25,"Love this color, will buy it again! ????"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,19-Nov-25,S?per suave e hidrata
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,18-Nov-25,"I have tried almost every lip gloss, oil, serum. They are sticky, smell odd, need constant reapplication. This tinted serum is beautiful. It goes on without an applicator which let's be honest, you contaminant the product every time it's put back in tube. Laneige's new tinted lip serum in cinnamon sugar is BEAUTIFUL, NONSTICKY, leaves my lips COMFORTABLE, soft and the simmery but not that cheap glitter goop. You won't know it's on because it's a serum!! I'll NEVER SWITCH."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,17-Nov-25,"I¡¯m a big fan of Laneige, and this product is no exception."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,17-Nov-25,"Great go-to for light-to-medium glossy coverage. I like how it applies ? it¡¯s ¡°thick¡± enough so that you can see the color on the tube and on your lips, but it¡¯s not an overwhelmingly goopy consistency or opaque color."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,15-Nov-25,Very nice.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,15-Nov-25,"Very moisturizing, smells like chocolate, easy to apply. Leaves a nice shine initially but I do have to reapply throughout the day."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,13-Nov-25,"This is a treatment balm disguised as a color balm. It gives a glassy shine, complete hydration for hours, and has a scent that makes you think of cinnamon buns. Ohhh my¡¦ yum. I¡¯ve ordered two shades now and adore both."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Nov-25,"Left my lips so dry, I needed a moisture stick to comfort them"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,11-Nov-25,"I really like the color and how it feels on. Not sticky. I wish they had left the applicator alone. It is flat now, used to be at an angle and you could control the amount more easily."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Nov-25,"GREAT smell & color!

Worst gloss applicator ever! Why, why, why?"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Nov-25,Instant hydration and a nice tint.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,10-Nov-25,"Every winter my lips dry out and they Crack, bleed, I get cuts at the corner of my mouth, dry season is horrible. I've tried a lot of other brands and it always feels ""too light"". But I bought this on a whim since I was pretty desperate. I am sooooo surprised that even though the formula is still light, it ACTUALLY penetrates my lips and makes it feel so comfortable and stretchy again. I love the smell too. I actually bought a second one because of how much better I felt and my lips healing.

I still use Aquafor and Vaseline of course, but dang this product is like an immediate relief. It helps with the pain of my lips too. The color is beautiful as well.

I'm just so glad I bought it, literally helped me so much. I can't believe I didn't buy it sooner.

Next year I am def just buying these ahead of time.

My lips still get dry (it is just ingrained in em) but dabbing this one brings immediate relief, color, and makes the pain go away."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,09-Nov-25,"The cutest light sheer lip gloss with a little pink tint, tastes good, applicator feels nice. Love it"
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,The pigment separated from the gloss. Half of the tube had no pigment and went on clear with no tiny. Very disappointing for the price. Will not purchase again.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,"The best. moisturizing, the scent and tint are great. not too much color, but just enough. lips have a light glaze not fried chicken greasy. perfect. this is my 5th tube. I bought one for every handbag and laptop case and keep one in the glove compartment of my car."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,Love this gloss. Moisturizing and a pretty sheer color. Not sticky. Smells great too.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,"I tried LANEIGE Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum Strawberry Sprinkles and found the color far too clear?didn¡¯t provide the tint I expected. The formula is also very goopy and feels heavy on the lips. Despite the hydrating and plumping claims, it wasn¡¯t comfortable to wear, and I wouldn¡¯t buy it again."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,This is my new favorite lip glaze! The color is natural and beautiful. It hydrates my lips and adds some shine. I carry one in my purse for touch ups during the day. Somehow it adds moisture and just enough shine without being sticky.
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,She¡¯s a queen and she¡¯s so beautiful on the lips. Just a light touch of baby pink and so moisturizing
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,08-Nov-25,Love this !
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,"This lip serum has a pretty color and gives a nice glossy finish without feeling sticky, which I really like. It feels lightweight and comfortable to wear, and the tint looks natural and flattering.
The only downside is that it¡¯s not as hydrating as I hoped, especially for something marketed as a lip serum. It¡¯s still a nice gloss overall, but I wish it provided a little more moisture."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,I recently discovered Laneige and have figured out why it has such great reviews!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,Drys my lips out little bit ¡¦ taste isn¡¯t bad shimmery and a pop of color is perfect
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,07-Nov-25,"A little expensive, but a little goes along way. Keep lips moistened and soft. The flavors are great too."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,Love the applicator and formula
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,"Me encant? todo, desde el olor hasta la textura del silicon que trae en el aplicador. El color es igual y si se siente los labios hidratados. Cumple con su funci?n y vale la pena su precio."
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,Certifiably obsessed with this lip gloss!!!!!
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,06-Nov-25,Great product
Glaze Craze Tinted Lip Serum,05-Nov-25,Very pretty girly packaging. The glaze lip serum gently tints your lips and the color stays on a very long time without making your lips feel dry or sticky.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Dec-25,Products smaller than expected but smell nice.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Dec-25,"It's a nice moisturizer. I wouldn't say it's exactly ""plumping"" or anything magical like that. Decent fair quality, moderate hydration and somewhat soft feeling set. The texture is creamy and super light. J do have to layer with a thicker moisturizer over winter."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Dec-25,Love this set great value!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Dec-25,I was given the caramel lip sleeping mask as a gift and Laniege has a new customer!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Dec-25,"So small,"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Dec-25,I have never tried a Laneige product that I didn¡¯t like! And this was no different the minis were super cute and work great! The masks and lip balm are both super hydrating!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Dec-25,great for gifts
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,20-Dec-25,The box says full size but the only product full size is the tube. I was very disappointed in the tiny pot.

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,Its a fun product and colors are on point it really gives a fuller lip look
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,Very cute and a great gift for Christmas.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,"Never a disappointment !! Great for sensitive skin. No strong fragrance
I have all full sizes and i bought this to travel"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,18-Dec-25,I bought this as a gift but I loveeee laneige lip care and the recipient loved the gift!! She said her lips were chapped going to bed and they woke up completely healed and soft! Highly recommend!

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,17-Dec-25,This is such a cute set and it was on sale and very affordable. My teen daughter will love it.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,17-Dec-25,"I love this brand I love the flavor mix (chocolates a little different, but not bad). I actually really like the mini tubes because they¡¯re so easy to carry around. Eggnog and caramel are actually so good."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,16-Dec-25,Love this brand. The bouncy firm line is amazing and my skin looks and feels great.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,16-Dec-25,"I was excited to get this set to use as Christmas gifts but they are super extra mini. I have a previous mini version of the lip sleeping mask and it¡¯s 8g-these are only 3g and the packaging looks very cheap. (Below you can see the mint is the old mini size and the brown is the one just rcvd)
The new ones are tiny and less than half full at that with completely hollow bottoms. I¡¯m returning because I thought I got a good deal but now it feels like a rip off."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,"Not bad , but super small for the price , wouldn¡¯t buy again ."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,You dont see it but at the bottom they obviously filled it to such a small amount. I dont know how to explain it but i attached a photo. Very good products though!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,Be aware these are very small sizes. Not sure I would recommend.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,Muy refrescante e hidratan durante el d?a y la noche
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,I love this product and use it every night all year. It keeps my lips soft and the tubs go a long way. It tastes like peppermint/ candy cane.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,"Best way to try these lip mask and glowy balms. I try each flavor so much, hot chocolate was my favorite. I love the smaller sizes and really enjoy the way my lips feel after use."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,15-Dec-25,Honestly not worth it
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,Great product for price
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"Bought for my friend, her granddaughter, and, of course, myself! Laneige lip masks are my go to every night, and the fun flavors makes it a treat, plus I wake up with conditioned lips."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"She loves this it's small ,but great for her"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"What a joke! These are SUPER EXTRA TINY sample sizes meant for 2-3 uses, especially the lip masks! They are deceiving in the photos. The product is way less than the actual container it comes in! And they have the nerve to have the original price be at $21? I see that greed has no limits nowadays. I am honestly disgusted with this company right now. Wont be ordering their products ever again."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,14-Dec-25,"I honestly loved this set and would absolutely buy it again, but I do want to note that the products are not full sized so buyers are aware. Even so, everything inside feels high quality and perfect for everyday self care, especially if you already like Laneige products or want to try them before committing to full sizes. The lip mask is super hydrating and makes a noticeable difference overnight, the lip glowy balm is perfect for daily use without feeling sticky, and the Water Bank moisturizer feels lightweight but still very moisturizing. All of the products work really well together and made my skin and lips feel soft, smooth, and taken care of. The packaging is also really cute which makes it great for gifting, but it is just as good to keep for yourself. Overall this is a solid set that actually delivers and feels like a treat without being overhyped."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,13-Dec-25,Nice gift for tween granddaughters.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,13-Dec-25,Originally bought for my friend as part of her gift well worth it for what all comes in it will be purchasing again
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,12-Dec-25,"I haven't tried much products from Laniege, but I will always repurchase their lip mask. Applying before bed and your lips feel so hydrated and plump the next morning.
I love that this kit has two styles of applications. I take the tube to go and leave the other one on my nightstand. Scents are also amazing. This one leave a nice minty tingle on the lips. Not overpowering at all."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,11-Dec-25,"Good variety to try the different scents, but I don¡¯t think it¡¯s a good value overall at all. It¡¯s almost all packaging. For how long it took to get it was actually really disappointing."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,11-Dec-25,My favorite products of all time.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,10-Dec-25,Received exactly as shown.

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,Perfect holiday lip kit. My 13 year old loves it!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,I always buy these mini sets instead of the large tub since it's around the same price but you get a larger variety of flavors. This one is perfect for winter so I can swap out some fruity chapstick with spiced eggnog or chocolate instead!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,"I bought these kits on a Black Friday sale at the urging of my sister, who bought it and loved it. I bought one for myself and two as gifts. I'm seriously considering keeping them all for myself - they're THAT good."

Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,"This duo is complete! It matches so well. The scent is strong and reminds you of Christmas time which you can¡¯t go wrong with.

It¡¯s a gift so I couldn¡¯t say much more than the flavor and package.

The package was small enough to wrap and ship. The price was great for a combo package of two items."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,Great price
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,09-Dec-25,Came as advertised for a Christmas gift.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,Excellent lip items. It Works & smells great.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,Product isn¡¯t bad but they are TINY!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,"This little set is great, my daughter will be thrilled for Christmas! It comes with flavors she likes and they are the perfect size to throw in a bag. Great price also!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,08-Dec-25,Dope af
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,07-Dec-25,"Purchase for my daughter as a Christmas gift so we have not opened it, but I was pleased with the sale price during Black Friday and she loves these products so I think she will be very happy with them"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,07-Dec-25,I get these every single year at Christmas time because it¡¯s my favorite scent in this lipgloss/lipbam. So I buy enough to last me throughout the year. I¡¯m extremely passionate about this product and I would recommend it to anyone that loves minty lip treatments. It¡¯s also a phenomenal value.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,07-Dec-25,Perfect Christmas gift for my daughter who is obsessed with all things beauty and skin care. The price was great! She will be happy Christmas morning.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,Nicely packaged. As expected
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,"I loooove their lip masks and this set did not disappoint! The smells are amazinggg however the pots are very very small. I know it¡¯s obvious, but I was a little surprised when i finished it within a week."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,"Bought it for a family member, she has used the same brand/product before and likes it. Package arrived as promised and in good condition, not much more to say."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,06-Dec-25,Great skincare
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,05-Dec-25,"I love this brand, it¡¯s long lasting and it moisturizes very good !"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,05-Dec-25,I love the variety of scents in this kit. It feels like a luxury kit. It makes an excellent gift.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,05-Dec-25,"I enjoy the sugar scrub and lip sleeping mask. The lip scrub doesn't seem to fully get rid of the dry skin. Scrub is overall smooth to apply, smells good and isn't gritty like others."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,This is a great product and the gift set is awesome!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,"My lips really dry out, especially in the winter and I've tried so many lip masks and overnight balms even the high end brands that really didn't work that well, so I was truly blown away when I tried this one. I went for the holiday scent but I'm really impressed and excited at how well this product actually worked. I use the lip mask at night and wake up with my lips still moist and I use the balm over blotted lipstick in these cold months to keep my lips from chapping during these cold temp days (typically my lip gloss works well for me most of the year, but can't keep up in the winter). Also, love that it's not sticky. Goes on smooth and lips feel great. Happy to have survived winter so far WITHOUT chapped lips!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,"The lip balm are somewhat moisturizing and have a pleasant scent, but I experience a lot of dread skin buildup with this product. I prefer Mario Badescu lip balm to this as it's more moisturizing and I never have dead skin buildup. I really wanted to like this product but I won't be purchasing again."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,great deal high quality mini products
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,04-Dec-25,"Nice lip care, great smell."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,"Love this gift set. I broke it up and put these into little gift bags for my co-workers. They LOVED them!

I got to save one for myself (the caramel one) and I am obsessed. Smells heavenly and does a good job keeping my lips moisturized! Also, I adore how tiny and precious each lip mask/balm is."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,"Moisturizing, smells good, and tastes good! I love Laniege and this is a great gift or stocking stuffer!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,The package was a lot smaller then the original picture on Amazon but the product is overall amazing
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,"Perfect packaging for a Christmas gift. The products are nice, even if the sizes are small, but the price is reasonable for gifting. It looks great and feels thoughtful."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,I love !! Everything is so tiny and cute. The lip mask are perfect for the winter. Chapped lips before bed? Put a good amount on and like nothing in the morning !! Sometimes I wear the mask through the day too specially in the winter months.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,03-Dec-25,Great value for the money. Love that it¡¯s discounted further with subscribe and save. Keep it stocked for teen gifts.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,Cute set and the price was right.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,Bien
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,My daughters all time favorite
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,02-Dec-25,I loved this
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,01-Dec-25,"These are MINI mini products. Like sample size. I saw that these were on sale for $16 and I've been wanting to try some other flavors so I went for it. I was shocked at how tiny the package was. The product itself is ok but the size for what we're paying for is silly. The sleep mask container is hollowed out underneath so you're only getting like a 1/4 tsp of product. Also the applicator for the glowy balm is hard plastic, not silicone like the full size product so it sucks to put the product on. Overall just super disappointed with the amount and the quality that we get in this package. I wouldn't recommend purchasing for this price."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,"The Laneige lip product I received arrived opened, used, and had writing on the packaging. This is not acceptable for a cosmetic item and raises hygiene concerns."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,Great for gifts!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,One of THE holiday gift items for tween girls.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,30-Nov-25,Great product! The jars of product are deceiving as the amount of product is half of the jar. Would buy again for the quality
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,29-Nov-25,"The products I received didn't help my lips at all. For 3 weeks I used the chocolate night cream every night and the vanilla cream several times a day. The chocolate cream stained my pillowcase and the vanilla cream felt like thin petroleum jelly. My lips were as dry as ever. After 3 weeks I went back to using my old lip balm.

Maybe I received a bad batch or a fake."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,29-Nov-25,Great gift and got it on sale. Super excited to give this to my friend for Christmas.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,A lot smaller than I thought but this will still last you months and is worth the price
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,La marca es genial
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,I loved the way they all applied and I think it¡¯s a good price for all the stuff in the package
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,26-Nov-25,I absolutely love these lip balms and masks! I also got them cheaper on here so it¡¯s totally worth it.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,25-Nov-25,"I've purchased the other nighttime lip masks from Laneige and have loved them, but this wasn't the winner for me. I don't really like chocolatey flavored lip care items -- ""brighter"" and fruitier flavors are for sure my preference so I will return to that. I was excited to try their ""daytime"" gloss but it's sticky and wears away quickly."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,24-Nov-25,"Both my daughter and I love the Laneige lip products! She wears the sleep mask every night and it¡¯s really helped keep her lips smooth and unchapped, especially since our climate is so dry! The peppermint scent is soft and not overwhelming. We even buy this as a great gift for her tween friends!"
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Nov-25,Using this set as a prize during our Christmas party games! Great product and pricng!
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,23-Nov-25,I love it perfect for traveling and having it at home it lasts for such a long time and a little goes a long way it has great pricing and is just an amazing product
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,It is more like a sample pack.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,This is the greatest skin care I have used.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,Love all the Laneige products.
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,22-Nov-25,"I always question when I see products advertised by influencers, but this is the real deal. Love it love it love it."
Laneige Skincare & Lip Care Holiday Gift Sets,21-Nov-25,Bought when it was on sale and used it for my bridesmaid proposal gifts!
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Dec-25,I bought this on a whim and it is a game changer. 'Pore Blurring' = Filter IRL. Definitely worth the purchase price and just makes me feel real cute. Softens too bronze/blushed areas of my face.
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Dec-25,"This powder is absolutely incredible! I never write reviews, but I am just blown away. I have mature skin and I have been using the same powder for at least 20 years. I decided to try this after having seen a news article. It sets my foundation with a matte finish while blurring pores and fine wrinkles. It doesn¡¯t add color and keeps my makeup from looking caked. I love it!"
Neo Blurring Powder,16-Dec-25,My holy grail! Definitely the best blurring powder I tried so far.
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Dec-25,"I don't know why but I wasn't expecting this to be a white loose powder. For some reason I thought it was more of a solid even though the description does say powder. That said, it's like cornstarch, it definitely creates a very matte effect but it should be used sparingly because otherwise it looks weird."
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Dec-25,This stuff is magic. Keeps my skin looking shine free all day. It¡¯s also easy to just throw in your bag if a touch up is needed.
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Dec-25,Worked good but I couldn't handle the smell I gave it away
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Dec-25,"I didn¡¯t use powder before, and my concealer used to crease into fine lines. That¡¯s no longer an issue with this. The finish looks very natural, and I also stay less shiny by the end of the day. Very happy with it."
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Dec-25,"Powder is so soft and smooth, I¡¯ll definitely buy it again when I run out!"
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Dec-25,"Overall a pretty good powder. The packaging is cool, but beyond the novelty of the dispenser, it's not too special. The powder looks alright, and it's not too overly drying."
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Dec-25,"I use this any day that I wear makeup now. If you have shiny or oily skin, give this a try."
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Dec-25,Leaves a plastic film feeling on my face without controlling any shine- a plus it even breaks me out!
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Dec-25,"Great blurring powder but the method of delivery is terrible. Pushing on the soft mesh screen does nothing. You have to turn the compact over and tap it onto the puff. Good product, terrible packaging."
Neo Blurring Powder,09-Dec-25,I¡¯m surprised this has such good reviews- it caused creasing around my eyes that I don¡¯t have when I use other powders
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Dec-25,"This powder delivers on its blurring promise - it really does create a smooth, airbrushed finish on the skin.
Dispenser concerns:
The push-down dispenser mechanism is a bit nerve-wracking to use. I never quite know how much product will come out when I press, which makes it tricky to avoid waste or getting too much powder at once. It takes some practice to get the feel for it.
I also can't see how much product remains in the compact, so I have no idea when I'll actually need a replacement. You're basically flying blind until it suddenly runs out.
The puff:
The included puff is wonderfully soft and fluffy, which feels nice on the skin. However, since I'm using this as a finishing powder over foundation, the puff picks up my foundation color pretty quickly. You'll likely want to wash it regularly or have a backup puff on hand.
Performance & portability:
No white cast, which is great (though full disclosure - I'm not very tanned, so those with deeper skin tones should test this). The compact is nicely sized for travel - small enough to slip into any bag without taking up much space.
Bottom line:
The blurring effect is fantastic and the compact size is convenient, but the dispensing system could use some improvement. If you can get past the learning curve with the dispenser, it's a solid finishing powder for touch-ups throughout the day."
Neo Blurring Powder,06-Dec-25,I'd love to buy it again!
Neo Blurring Powder,04-Dec-25,I luv this and it deserves more love from influencers
Neo Blurring Powder,04-Dec-25,"I¡¯m not a big makeup person, but I tried so many other brands and this one is so far the best one I¡¯ve ever tried. I¡¯m very impressed."
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Nov-25,"Y¡¯all!!! There¡¯s magic in this little thing!!! I swear! This blurring powder will take five years off your face in 15 seconds. I¡¯ve been through my share. I¡¯m a total makeup junkie- (it¡¯s a problem) and the results are almost unbelievable. I¡¯m trying so hard not to sound like a 1-800-Call-Now and I know I¡¯m failing. Feel free to laugh, but push that ¡°Buy Now¡± button as fast as you can!

The compact design itself is really fantastic too. Someone actually thought ahead and realized this would be tossed in a purse, bag, whatever.

The little silicone mesh part is just cool and dispenses the perfect amount. It¡¯s nice to stop spilling powder everywhere and wasting product. I wish everything powder came like this.
You NEED this, whether you¡¯re in the market for blurring powder or not.
Absolutely fantastic."
Neo Blurring Powder,29-Nov-25,Very nice powder. Works well.
Neo Blurring Powder,27-Nov-25,"Does not blur anything. Would not recommend for women over 35. It shows every line. Also, not a fan of the packaging, really hard to get the powder evenly out."
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Nov-25,This is my favorite blurring powder!
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Nov-25,"the powder is great, but the carrying clip-on bit makes it so you can't open the powder. kinda defeats the purpose"
Neo Blurring Powder,25-Nov-25,Really makes a difference. Like a little subtle filter. No coverage but makes bare skin prettier and nice over foundation.
Neo Blurring Powder,21-Nov-25,This powder was quite subtle and took away any oily looks after applying foundation. I was pleasantly surprised. Worth the price!
Neo Blurring Powder,20-Nov-25,"Absorbs oil well, but looks too powdery on my skin."
Neo Blurring Powder,19-Nov-25,"Nothing special. It's really a green-tinted loose powder that is probably intended to mute red tones. I don't think that works. If you want to carry around a very cute compact of loose powder in your purse, you may like it. I like the loose powder from IT Cosmetics a lot more than this because it helps to conceal pores."
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Nov-25,Loved this powder. My favorite thing about it is how easy it is to travel with it. It has a unique dispenser that only is supposed to dispense when you press on it. I've traveled with mother powders that are so messy after being knocked around. This does do a very good job setting and blurring.
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Nov-25,LOVE how well this blurs my pores! My pores are so large! This helps make them disappear or appear smaller depending on the day. Not cake like at all and is easy to remove. I need to actually get a refill soon I have been using it so much! I love the Laneige line anyways for cleaning my face and moisturizer so I am excited that it is a product made by them because I trust them.
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Nov-25,Me encanta!!!!
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Nov-25,"I have combination skin type. My T zone ( forehead, nose and chin area) are oily and rest of my face is dry. This powder keeps my oily area nice and matt all day long and doesn¡¯t dry out my cheeks or eye area. Perfect for everyday use. They made this powder so convenient to use at home or on the go. I highly recommend to everyone or all skin type"
Neo Blurring Powder,16-Nov-25,Absolutely the best product!!! I don¡¯t have any shine all day long and it doesn¡¯t look like a flat matte face. So impressed that I¡¯ve thrown away all my other high-price facial powders?I will be only using this Laneige powder.
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Nov-25,f?rmula is great but the packaging has a mesh thing that makes it hard to get the product evenly on the applicator
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Nov-25,"This seems to work pretty well - I don't seem as shiny afterwards! I like the little poof used to apply the product, although it's kind of hard to handle with the little strap. Overall, this is a great product, and I will definitely use it frequently!"
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Nov-25,Love it - flawless finish!
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Nov-25,"Horrible. I have oily tan skin and this barely removes the oil and leaves more of a white residue. Don't waste your money, there are better products out there."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"I bought this because of all the great reviews, so I think that maybe it's just me...

The powder does not dispense easily, which is annoying. Also... I see NO difference in my face with vs. without it. My face is not oily, but I do have issues with my pores on my nose and chin."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,This is ok but it doesn¡¯t control oil well or blur much but it¡¯s a decent enough setting powder
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,This stuff is literally magic for us oily-skinned gals. It soaks the oil right off the face and you¡¯re left shine free! Highly recommend.
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"I don't know if I would consider this revolutionary but it is a decent, fine powder and I appreciate the compact which makes it convenient and easy to travel with. It does do a decent job of blurring pores as well."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,Great powder
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,Great product. Really helps my skin and helps with my make up application.
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,Does a great job blurring. I have not worn long enough to know how it settles but it¡¯s been good so far.
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"Expensive and honestly, not sure this does anything. I have something similar that cost nine dollars from target and I would buy that over and over again before I bought this again."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Nov-25,"Like it and really helped with keeping the makeup in place and no shine but the cushion that comes with it gets stained so quickly with foundation and after a wash, the material wasn¡¯t as soft anymore."
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Nov-25,"I really love this face powder!
A bit expensive but totally worth it!"
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Nov-25,Amazing amazingly smooth and fine powder. Goes on nicely feels soft to the touch
Neo Blurring Powder,09-Nov-25,Love it! Blurs perfectly. I would definitely buy again
Neo Blurring Powder,08-Nov-25,Magic !!!! I¡¯d but stock in this product
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Nov-25,"This powder helps keep my oiliness away for a bit longer than without it. However, I do not like the way this powder looks on me. I tried over and under my foundation, less, more, setting spray before and/or after, different setting sprays, as a setting powder, baking, and it just always looks weird. Idk, I¡¯ll keep trying though till it¡¯s gone but I do not have high hopes."
Neo Blurring Powder,05-Nov-25,The puff came already used. I was disgusted.
Neo Blurring Powder,05-Nov-25,No different than any other translucent powder. Oily skin will come through between applications
Neo Blurring Powder,03-Nov-25,"I just received it today. The first thing I noticed was that the packaging was open, but I assumed it was just from transport. I was really disappointed to see that the applicator it came with had tan discoloration as if it was previously used for applying foundation, concealer, etc. The powder part was still sealed but I¡¯m still skeptical about the integrity of the product considering its state when I received it."
Neo Blurring Powder,03-Nov-25,Was an amazing product full coverage and totally blurring
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Nov-25,"The powder itself did reduce shine better than other brands, but it's because it's extra drying. Look at my pic how this powder dried out my skin around my mouth with lots of peeling.

I have dry skin that always produces extra oil so I have to blot all day. I used the same skincare (La Mer cream) and sunscreen. The only item I used differently was the Laneige powder. With La Mer cream being on the greasy side, Laneige powder still dried out my skin badly. This powder itself is a great product if it doesn't dry you out.

However, the packaging is really bad. It releases only a little bit of loose powder onto the small puff extremely unevenly, making application spotty and ineffective, and makes the puff dirty from foundation. It'll be much better if this powder comes in a typical loose powder container or in a pressed powder compact. Either is better than this packaging."
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Nov-25,"I wish I tried this sooner! This is PERFECT for people like me who have perpetually oily foreheads. The best product for oil control. After applying, it leaves the skin with an interesting texture, which isn¡¯t a bad thing, just an observation. I used to use the Laura Mercier setting powder, but this is leagues ahead! I love that there¡¯s a spot for the puff in the packaging."
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Nov-25,"I had high hopes for this product, but the texture is not great on two types of liquid makeup and as a setter for BB cream. The pad wasted more product than what actually made it to my face."
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Oct-25,This product is amazing and makes my skin look flawless!
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Oct-25,"Bought this due to an influencer video that I follow. I like most of her recommended products, but not this one. I gave 3 stars because I do like the compact design. There is a barrier between the powder and the puff so it doesn't go everywhere. I purchased the translucent, but it makes my skin look very dull. I would not recommend this product."
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Oct-25,The puff that came with it is discolored with someone else's foundation (see picture).
Neo Blurring Powder,25-Oct-25,"Fair performance, it does blot out shine and pores but not any better than regular powders for less money"
Neo Blurring Powder,24-Oct-25,As someone who has struggled with oily skin this has been such a wonderful find. It most definitely helps and I can highly recommend it. Gives a nice clean finish without a matte look.
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Oct-25,"It seems like a nice product. Leaves skin soft.
I don¡¯t think it¡¯s hypoallergenic though. I do have lots of environmental allergies, but most make up I have never have a problem with. Every time I use this powder, even just on my chin, my eyes itched and watered and burned. I ended up giving it to my daughter. Just something to consider."
Neo Blurring Powder,20-Oct-25,"It's face powder. I read the hype and I am disappointed. I thought it would cover my face, somehow miraculously.
It actually was worse coverage compared to other face powders I have used."
Neo Blurring Powder,19-Oct-25,Definitely does its job! ??
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Oct-25,Product I received was clearly used. Opened the first time and the puff had product embedded. Disgusting.
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Oct-25,"Stays matte, little goes a long way"
Neo Blurring Powder,18-Oct-25,I am satisfied with the quality of the product
Neo Blurring Powder,17-Oct-25,very matte and smoothing I'm surprised how blurring it is!
Neo Blurring Powder,16-Oct-25,This product really works well. No wrinkles!
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Oct-25,"The product doesn't get on the provided puff that well and in my experience, you have to kind of add a lot for prominent results which is fine."
Neo Blurring Powder,15-Oct-25,"oh wow! This powder is pure witchery. I have no idea how or what¡¦ but it makes my face a perfect palette. My skin looks so even and pretty. I only wear a little makeup- some under eye concealer, blush, highlighter and tinted lip gloss. but this powder makes me makeup look even better. I used to think the natural dew-y look was the way to go, but this smooth matte finish is way cuter, mostly because my skin tone looks more even and my face looks polished. When you press the puff into the compact you even wonder if anything is coming out. But clearly something is working! Love it so much."
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Oct-25,"Its good. I love the puff that comes with it, and appreciate the creative packaging. Powder is a tough one, but they figured it out. It goes on smooth, but I don't love the way it sits over my foundation. It could just be that my Makeup Forever foundation doesn't mix well with this powder, but it leaves me looking a little cakey and settles into my fine lines."
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Oct-25,You¡¯re not kidding in the blurring. This stuff is witchcraft in the best possible way. I¡¯m 52 and it wears in my skin well. I¡¯m a huge follower of the Laneige brand of which I started with the lip mask and oh those are amazing as well ladies!
Neo Blurring Powder,14-Oct-25,Didn¡¯t see much of a difference was not a fan of the product and left my skin blocthy
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Oct-25,"10/5 stars for my oily face! It's a beautiful powder that sets my makeup without looking cakey. It keeps my face looking smooth and blurred for much, much longer than any other powder I've used before. I'm glad I finally decided to take a chance on it because it's been worth it for me.

I prefer to use the cushion to pick up the powder and then use a brush to pick up the powder from the cushion because it keeps the cushion from getting gunked up with oils and makeup residue, which cuts down on how often I need to wash the cushion.

If you struggle with your face becoming shiny after just a couple of hours, this is the powder for you. It's not expensive when you compare it to high end Western powders, plus you can get refills for it.

The packaging is lovely, designed well, feels great to hold and use, and makes the product portable. However the box and the compact didn't come with a tamper-proof safety seal (see my pics). I was a bit apprehensive about it. I looked it up and it's apparently just how they package and ship this product. I think it's sensible to add safety seals to all beauty products, but I'll get over it because I love this powder. The powder itself has a type of seal over it (which comes with a short set of instructions) to keep the powder from falling out, but I wouldn't call that seal tamper-proof."
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Oct-25,"This powder is amazing.
I use it as a setting AND finishing powder.
I have very very VERY oily skin.
Makeup stays put ALL day!
When my oils start to seep through I use blotting sheets and everything is still perfect after blotting.
My skin looks and feels like velvet.
I am very impressed.
The compact is cute and I appreciate that I can buy a refill of the powder.
Excellent."
Neo Blurring Powder,13-Oct-25,"After using it a couple of times, I¡¯m obsessed. It makes my skin look so smooth and matte without feeling dry, and it really does blur my pores. The puff is super soft and applies the product evenly. I¡¯ve actually been reaching for this way more than my Givenchy Libre Prism powder. Love this find and love the Laneige brand even more now. I find the price point to be more than fair considering the quality, lightweight consistency, and results."
Neo Blurring Powder,12-Oct-25,Can't believe how well this worked to control shine and keep my makeup fully in place! Went to a wedding and would've usually ended up sweaty/shiny...my makeup looks like it did at the start of the night. I have oily/combination skin and this is the only product that's ever kept me from getting shiny by the end of the night
Neo Blurring Powder,11-Oct-25,I really like the powder but I actually didn't like the container. works great at first but as you use up product it gets harder getting product out. I cut mine open because I thought it was almost empty and it was like half full.
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,Love this stuff!!! Great for older skin!
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,"If I put it on and take a photo it's very visible in the photo. I don't like the material of the sponge that comes with the powder, it feels like it'll retain powder and bacteria significantly more than other options. It's also difficult to get powder when I want to use it, but it easily spilled in my drawer, where it was sitting upright correctly, and the drawer only opens pulled out. That was concerning that I had powder spilled in the drawer and on my hands when I pulled it out. I do like that there's a separate spot for the sponge to sit while it's put away. I prefer a different power I purchased from a different Korean brand."
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,Really doesn¡¯t work
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,"Wow, can't say enough. Packaging makes this powder a breeze and not a giant mess.
I have oily/combo skin, and was not patchy or drying. Helped with my fine lines, lasted around 8-10 hours on my skin and was easily able to touchup with the little fluffy pouf it comes with.
I will be re-purchasing because the formula, either under or over my foundation, works great! There is no white cast, and works great with brushes or sponges. I also use it to set my eyeshadows, and it's so light that there is no movement and my eyeshadows look great all day.
I'm picky and sensitive with packed powder/loose powder - and this can function as both!"
Neo Blurring Powder,10-Oct-25,Where has this been all my life?!!! Works perfectly to blur makeup and give an oil free appearance! Worth every penny!! Get it!!
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Oct-25,"Where has this been all my life. My skin is fairly oily, and I apply this every morning after my foundation, and my makeup lasts all day with 0 touchups."
Neo Blurring Powder,07-Oct-25,Cute little case (like if Apple designed and powder compact). It holds the puff away from the powder. Case is a little fat but it¡¯s cute. Not a whole lot of powder but the mechanism works well for dispensing loose powder without making a huge mess.
Neo Blurring Powder,06-Oct-25,This stuff is fantastic! Kept my makeup looking fresh all day through the humid Florida summer. Love how it takes the shine out of my face and lightly blurs my pores. Forever part of my daily routine.
Neo Blurring Powder,02-Oct-25,This line is really awesome. I love the blurring powder and the sleeping masks!!!!!
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Sep-25,"It¡¯s pricey for a powder but case is pretty and compact. Powder last long and very silky
travel friendly overall satisfying!"
Neo Blurring Powder,30-Sep-25,"Doesn¡¯t blur so much as just give a white cast to the skin. It does absorb oil! If that is your only concern, it¡¯s fine. But if you¡¯re anything other than a porcelain complexion, probably not for you. I¡¯m white, by the way, but a *little* tan from summer I guess?"
Neo Blurring Powder,29-Sep-25,This is a MUST HAVE for oily skin! Love this product and use it daily to help keep my shine under control!
Neo Blurring Powder,29-Sep-25,This powder works wonders to control oil in the summer months. It is way too drying to use in the winter or dry months though. Oh and a little bit goes a long way.
Neo Blurring Powder,28-Sep-25,This product works well! I like that it doesn't change the color of your other makeup or powders when applying. It controls oil and very light weight!
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Sep-25,This is the holy grail of setting powders and I love the packaging
Neo Blurring Powder,26-Sep-25,"This order was used packaged like it was new, but when opened, it was clearly used. The sponge was dirty with foundation and the mirror had powder on it. Gross."
Neo Blurring Powder,23-Sep-25,Came in with a broken closing mechanism and wouldn¡¯t close. The product itself is ok though takes multiple applications and it¡¯s hard to get an even distribution on the puff.
Neo Blurring Powder,23-Sep-25,"This powder is sort of like witchcraft! It really does what it says, and that just a light application provides beautiful blurring and modifying of the skin. It¡¯s very light, and looks great even on my 50+ year-old skin. It does not accentuate creases or lines at all. Will definitely be buying this product again"
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Sep-25,Not sure what the hype is with this brand and this powder. Bought because I saw it and it looked convincing but I will return to IT blurring powder. Works better for me. It's hard to get product on the pad and the pad gets oily fast and you have to wash it I don't know it's just a strange concept the whole container the way it opens the tiny amount of powder... More gimmicky than anything else.
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Sep-25,Bought this powder on Amazon Prime Day on discount just to try it. It works so much better than my expensive powders. It¡¯s my new favorite make up item. Definitely a great find!
Neo Blurring Powder,22-Sep-25,I¡¯m not sure if this was used but it¡¯s disgusting
